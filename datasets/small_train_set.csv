9560	9561	Sam Adams founder: Beer is more than just 'cold, fizzy and in a can' 	"The craft beer boom, which and been attributed to millennials, has been kind to brewers like Samuel Adams, which have been brewing craft beers for the past 30 years – when millennials weren't even born. The increasing interest in craft beers hasn’t gone unnoticed by beer giants like MillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch. As a result, the two companies have tried their hands at scooping up a part of the market for themselves – MillerCoors’ with Blue Moon and Anheuser-Busch with Shock Top. Their efforts haven’t been for nothing. , Shock Top is the fastest growing craft beer. Similarly, in the last four years. And while many fans of real craft beers – – argue that those , semantics matter little when it comes to sales. It’s hard to compete with companies like that when it comes to production, admits Jim Koch, founder of Boston Beer Company, which brews Samuel Adams beers. Boston Beer Company has 1,000 employees and , meaning they are to beer what sommeliers are to wine. Koch talks about making beer for creativity, quality and taste – throwing in rose hips and other garden-scented ingredients into a spring beer and expanding product offerings. Sam Adams is also expanding beyond beer into hard cider and malt beverages, which consumers have been demanding more, , a beverage industry analyst for Standard and Poor’s. In response, Samuel Adams started producing , which became the country's top-selling cider only eight months after it launched, and a hard iced tea called Twisted Tea. For now, of the beer market. To find out more about life at Sam Adams, we caught up with him to chat about everything from micro-brewing to micro-lending to being a bridesmaid. It's surprising. You know when I started Sam Adams 30 years ago, even the term ""craft beer"" did not exist. If you told me [then] that in 30 years, American craft brewers would have changed the landscape – not only in United States, but set a model for craft brewing in the rest of the world – I would have been stunned. Craft beer is in a middle of a boom in the US. In a declining US beer industry, craft beer grew 20% last year. When I started, my business plan was that it would take five years to grow to 5,000 barrels, which was about $1m in revenue and eight employees, and then it would level off. I was horribly wrong, but horribly wrong in a right direction. Well, Sam Adams has become the leading craft brewer, one of the original pioneers. To me, a lot of the fun is to continue pioneer new beers and other innovations like cider. Last year, we put in a nano brewery in Boston to be able to do 10-gallon batches of beer and to continue to experiment with beer styles, new brewing techniques, new ingredients in beer. We had a really successful this year that had rose hips, powdered plums, hibiscus, anise, vanilla, tamarind, grains of paradise, lemon zest, coriander, orange peel. I think that the continuing hallmarks of Sam Adams in particular and craft beer in general are creativity and innovation. It's pretty interesting. Most people don't know this, but my background is in manufacturing and quality control. I was a manufacturing consultant for Boston Consulting Group, BCG, for almost seven years. I enjoyed it. I learned a lot about business and after six years, I guess, I wasn't learning that much more about business, I was learning about how to be a consultant, and I didn't want to be a consultant for the rest of my life. So when I realized that, I told BCG that I wanted to leave and I didn't want to work for a big corporation. I've seen them in my years as a consultant and it just wasn't a place that I wanted to go. I saw the dysfunctions of big corporations and I really didn't want to be part of that. I decided that I would start my own company – I just didn't know what at first. I thought about a lot of things and kept coming back to brewing. And again, there were no craft beers back then. There was no role model for success, but it was something that I was passionate about. I am actually the sixth oldest son in a row to be a brewer. So, there was a certain pull from that family history and it just all came together. It seemed that it was going to be something that would be really challenging, but worthwhile. We are selling higher quality beers and in order to do that you gotta have more highly trained people who can describe to the consumer the quality and character of the beer. This has been true since the beginning, because I sold the beer myself for most of the company's history. What I soon realized was that I wasn't just offering a physical product, I had to educate people about quality and taste in beer and where it came from and what the ingredients were and what the style was. [I had] to teach people to think about beer differently than cold, fizzy and in a can, which was the way people thought about beer when I started. I learned early on that I was not just providing product, a beer; I needed to provide beer education and tradition. At that point, my original investors had been in for over a decade and had not seen any return on their investment. My investors were not institutions – [they were] drinking buddies, some relatives. And they have seen no return on their investment even though the company had been successful, so going public was a way for them to get a return on their investment, but for me to continue to keep control of it, because I have all the voting shares. Not so much, because I still have all the voting shares so I still have control. Being public has its plusses and minuses. One of the plusses is increased transparency, which is not a bad thing for a company. Because of the voting shares, I can focus on long-term success and value creation. I don't have to worry about quarterly earnings, even annual earnings, because nobody can fire me. It's a little different that way – I can focus on long-term value creation. To me, you should be innovative about all the important things that you do. Frankly, I was a little naive, but I thought public offering meant that the shares went to the public. And when the bankers described the process to me, I realized: ""Oh, no, the public can't really get shares."" Particularly, if it's a good deal. Institutions get the shares and then the public gets to buy them at a mark-up. I think we were the first ones to do this – we put coupons on six packs and we sold shares . So the public actually got the lower price and the investment banks were … ah, didn't want to do that. They were arm-twisting about truly letting the public in to the public offering and a lot of those people still hold shares, almost 20 years later. Those are the kind of investors you want. That was just fun. I got to be a bridesmaid. I was a bridesmaid three times. Truly, I am always a bridesmaid, never a bride. The inspiration goes all the way back to when I went to not just Harvard Business School, but Harvard Law School. While I was there, I worked on the environmental law review and wrote an article about what was then called corporate social responsibility, making the observation that companies that seem to pay attention to that actually performed better financially. It's my belief that companies that are mindful of their larger responsibilities beyond just shareholder returns, generally perform better with their shareholders. We always had a number of philanthropic activities but they were not that satisfying to me. The one that was kind of an epiphany for me was painting a community center here. The management team went out and we spent the day working together painting a community center that needed work, but couldn't afford it. And I didn't feel really good about it, because as a business my mission is to add value. I was walking back to my car and I realized I probably spent $20,000 worth of management time to do about $2,000 worth of bad painting. That's not creating value. I felt that Boston should bring the same creativity and innovation to our philanthropic activities that we do to the rest of our business. We took a year, thought about a lot of different things with the focus on: how do we add the most value to our communities? We settled on Brewing the American Dream, which is a micro-lending and coaching and counseling program for small business in the area that we know, which is food, beverage and hospitality. That's something that we are good at and we have people who are very knowledgeable. The other part in the origin is that when I started Sam Adams, I realized there were a lot of things, nuts and bolts of business, that I didn't understand and where I made mistakes. I've got a business degree from Harvard Business School and a law degree from Harvard Law School, you'd think I would know some of this stuff. But there's just so many nuts and bolts when you start a small business and you are a CEO of everything … I knew about brewing, I was passionate about beer but I didn't know how to negotiate a real estate lease. I didn't know how to set up payroll. I didn't know how to make a sales call. I didn't know how to design a label. I didn't know how to hire PR. I could go on and on. And those are all really important things. So what we do is, in addition to the loans, we provide coaching and counseling on nuts and bolt in food, beverage and hospitality. We have sessions called speed coaching; it's a technique modeled on speed dating that we invented for this program. We got small business owners and entrepreneurs to come – here in Boston, we usually do it at the brewery – and they will sign up for 20-minute coaching sessions with six or eight different experts in the area that are relevant to their business, problems that they are struggling with. They'd go one place and talk to a guy whose expertise is procuring unusual ingredients from all over the world, because some of these entrepreneurs come up with these interesting recipes from their own cultures. Then the next place they'd go talk to somebody about how do you design a package for it. And the next place will be how do you do an interview, how do you hire people. So they get instant expertise on these areas where nuts and bolts really matter. ﻿﻿We have been making cider in the US for almost 20 years and about three years ago, we came to believe that there was an opportunity in cider that was somewhat like craft beer 30 years ago – a traditional beverage that had a lot of quality, natural ingredients, but was underrepresented in the United States. I believe cider was 0.2% of the US beer market. We've been making cider for almost 20 years, but a lot of it was playing around, experimenting with different apples. We got our technical expertise from two gentlemen who retired from , [an Irish cider maker] in the mid-90s. One was the technical director there and one was the head cider maker. So we had access to two of the world's best cider makers that trained us for 20 years and we decided to put that learning to use and developed a new cider called Angry Orchard. It has been significantly more successful than we thought and it created a lot of excitement and growth in the cider category in the US. Since we launched angry orchard, the cider category has tripled – off of a really small base. I don't know how big it's going to get. I don't know if it's going to keep growing, but it's the kind of high quality, traditional, niche product where we can bring some innovation around quality. That's going to help develop a category. That's really at the core of our mission and strategy, because as a small company – we're only over 1% of the US beer business – we can't compete on cost and efficiency with the large global brewers. They are so much better at that than we could ever be. As a result, we have to do something unique, different and something that's inherently small. If it's going to be a big category quickly, big brewers are going to be much better at it than we are. Actually, it's been not quite a year. Again, to illustrate the point, before we did that, we spent almost two years redesigning the beer can to create a better taste experience. We have that is different than the standard beer can. It has a different shape on the top and a larger, wider lid, both of which open your mouth up when you are drinking from Sam Adams can so it makes it more like drinking from a glass. Typical beverage cans, as consumer is well aware, [are] the same. Whether you are putting beer in it or diet soda or tomato juice or energy drink, every beverage can is the same. It's clearly not optimized for beer. And if you notice when you are drinking from a can, the can is designed to have as small as possible lid, because that is the cheapest can. The lid is the most expensive part, that's why cans taper in so that you get the smallest possible lid cause that will give you the cheapest can. Unfortunately, what that means for a taste experience as you drink from a standard beverage can, you essentially suck out of it. You form a seal with your mouth over the opening and suck the beverage out of it. You don't actually get the flavor experience until you pull it away from your mouth, and you get air ingress into your nasal and retro nasal passages. In Sam Adams can, the wider and hour glass shape at the top of it – so it doesn't just come in, it comes in and then it goes out. Those function to force your mouth to open as you drink from it, so you drink more slowly, but you get more taste."	Business
10801	10802	Slump in oil prices could mean fall in investment and future shortages – IEA 	The International Energy Agency has warned that the current slump in oil prices will hold back investment and could create shortages in the future as overall energy demand is forecast to grow by 37% in the next 25 years. But at the same time, the organisation, which was set up in the aftermath of previous price shocks, said that while more drilling was needed, it was still important that governments wound down the world’s $550bn (£346bn) of annual fossil fuel subsidies and switched support to renewable power. The IEA said oil and gas would play a continuing role as demand continued to rise, but that politicians should not shirk the need to tackle climate change, as the current trajectory of carbon use would leave humanity facing “a very different” world. “Today’s price level may offer some comfort to consumers but it will not last very long,” said Fatih Birol, IEA chief economist. “A well-supplied oil market in the short term should not disguise the challenges that lie ahead, as the world is set to rely more heavily on a relatively small number of producing countries.” Birol, speaking at the , said there were already signs of a 10% cut in US spending by oil companies as a result of the slump in oil prices there to $80 per barrel. This came at a time when investment in other key future crude producers such as Iraq was close to zero. American shale oil and gas had transformed the market but post-2020 the world would increasingly find itself relying on Canada, Brazil and the politically volatile Middle East for world oil supplies, he said. Birol said countries such as Russia, China and India needed to wind down their consumer-price subsidies for fossil fuels, which deterred renewable power investment, squandered valuable energy resources and gave their citizens “all the wrong messages.” The IEA estimates that wind, solar and other renewable technologies received subsidies of $121bn last year and this figure would rise to $230bn by 2030 before falling back to $205bn in 2040. The organisation hailed the performance of renewables as “incredible” and expected it to provide half of global electricity generation by 2040, with the bulk of the advances being made in China. “As our global energy system grows and transforms, signs of stress continue to emerge,” said Maria van der Hoeven, the IEA’s executive director. “But renewables are expected to go from strength to strength, and it is incredible that we can now see a point where they become the world’s number one source of electricity generation.” The IEA also gave its support to the development of new nuclear power projects, but said it was vital that governments found a permanent solution to dealing with high level radioactive waste. A separate report warned that uncertainty in the UK over subsidies for offshore windfarms had forced the industry to shelve a series of new projects. The study by the independent thinktank Green Alliance, titled , argued that without a long-term commitment, the industry would be unable to achieve the economies of scale needed to bring down costs. Energy secretary Ed Davey said this week that onshore wind power was already suffering after communities secretary Eric Pickles called in 50 planning applications. Davey said the Tory minister was undermining investor confidence in an industry that employs more than 15,000 workers.	Business
6726	6727	British Gas owner Centrica warns of higher gas costs 	"Senior executives at British have been accused of being an ""utter disgrace"" after being awarded a potentially generous pay deal just as they warned that more price rises were on the way. The attack from a member of parliament's energy and climate change committee came as a large group of shareholders voted against the remuneration report while other companies faced the latest blowback from the ""shareholder spring"". Vladimir Kim, the top shareholder in the mining firm Kazakhmys, said he would step down as chairman within 12 months, a new executive pay package at oil services group Petrofac faced opposition from shareholders and a quarter of investors rejected a remuneration report at shipbroker Clarkson. But the greatest acrimony came at , the parent group of British Gas, after it warned that it might have to increase energy bills this winter by at least £50. John Robertson, a Glasgow MP, who sits on the energy select committee, said: ""It's clear that Centrica think this is a good day to bury bad bills. The fact they chose this day to announce these price rises, when [former chief executive of News International] Rebekah Brooks is before [the] Leveson [inquiry)], shows they are an utter disgrace,"" he said. ""This government has to act to put an end to greedy gas companies taking hard-pressed customers for a ride. Pensioners in my constituency are only just getting over the budget, now they are hit with the prospect of rising energy bills."" Centrica's chief executive, Sam Laidlaw, and the British Gas managing director, Phil Bentley, were accused by one investor of presiding over an ""arrogant"" company that had been fined £2.5m for not investigating customer complaints properly. Another shareholder asked Laidlaw whether he would hand back the bonus element of his remuneration package of nearly £4m, a question that finally triggered an impassioned defence of the chief executive by Sir Roger Carr, the Centrica chairman. ""We are very fortunate to have Sam Laidlaw for this business,"" said Carr. ""For five years he has done a remarkable job for this company and one I am very proud to be associated with."" The group pay arrangements had very high hurdles in place that had to be overcome for bonus payouts to be made, he argued, but 12% of shareholders still voted against the remuneration report when it came up for approval. Both the Pension & Investment Research Consultant and the Association of British Insurers had raised concerns about the pay proposals. Meanwhile in a statement British Gas said wholesale gas prices for the forthcoming winter were about 15% higher than last year and non-commodity costs – such as transportation and environment levies – could add £50 to the cost of supplying the average household this year."

12365	12366	Ole Gunnar Solskjaer appointed manager of Cardiff City 	" is confident he will have complete control of football matters as Cardiff City's new manager and has insisted that he has no reservations about working under Vincent Tan, the club's controversial owner. Speaking on the day he was appointed as Malky Mackay's successor, Solskjaer said that he was going into the job with ""open eyes"" and with the aim of turning Cardiff into a top-10 Premier League club. The Norwegian, who has agreed a 12-month rolling contract, dismissed suggestions that Sir Alex Ferguson had told him not to go anywhere near the Cardiff position as ""absolute nonsense"" but admitted he had received ""one or two text messages"" from friends in football advising him against replacing Mackay, who was sacked last Friday. Explaining a decision that has taken many people by surprise, in particular in Norway, Solskjaer said: ""Everything isn't exactly what it seems from the outside."" The 40-year-old said that there was no need for anyone to be concerned about whether he had made the right call to leave Molde for a club plagued by off-the-field problems this season. ""I am really looking forward to the challenge,"" said Solskjaer, who will be joined by Mark Dempsey and Richard Hartis, two former Manchester United youth coaches who worked with him at Molde. ""Whenever the manager put me on the bench [at Manchester United], I wanted to prove to him he is wrong. And if there is any doubts, don't worry, I'm coming into this with clear and open eyes, I know what I'm going into and I'm so looking forward to it. I'm going to bring my energy, enthusiasm, football knowledge … I want my team to play exciting football, we want the fans to come here and be proud of us."" legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the new Cardiff City manager. See you at Old Trafford on 28 January, Ole. When it was pointed out to Solskjaer that Ferguson, whom he played under at Manchester United with such success and continues to refer to as ""gaffer"", has always said that the manager should be the most important person at a football club, the Norwegian replied: ""I agree. I am very confident that football matters, that is my matter."" BREAKING: are delighted to confirm the arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as first team manager. Solskjaer stressed the importance of creating a culture at Cardiff where there is ""good dialogue"" and said that he enjoyed a ""great meeting"" with Tan at the Emirates Stadium on New Year's Day, when he watched .

Mehmet Dalman, the Cardiff chairman, said that he is ""100% convinced"" Solskjaer can make the step up to Premier League management. ""I am a fan of the way he plays football and the way he looks at the game,"" Dalman said. ""We will see much more attacking football from Ole. Also, I like the way he communicates – that, for me, is crucial in the role I play, communicating with the manager and the rest of the hierarchy all the way up to the owner. Ole ticks all those boxes."""	Football
11782	11783	Sunderland target loan signings of Kurt Zouma and Jack Rodwell 	Kurt Zouma and Jack Rodwell are on Sunderland’s summer shopping list with Lee Congerton, the club’s sporting director, hoping to secure the Chelsea centre-half and the midfielder on season-long loans. The 19-year-old Zouma, who cost Chelsea £12m from Saint-Etienne last season, is regarded as a centre-half of outstanding potential. José Mourinho is understood to be keen to loan him out next season. Zouma would offer Gus Poyet much needed defensive pace along with competition for Wes Brown and John O’Shea. The manager faces competition from Monaco for Zouma’s signature. Everton and West Bromwich Albion are also believed to be keen on Rodwell, who has struggled to make an impact at City after leaving Goodison Park. He would help fill the gap at the Stadium of Light created by Jack Colback’s defection to Newcastle United.	Football
14176	14177	Yes or no, Scots will 'just get on with it', says Scotland's first billionaire 	"Scottish business will ""just get on with it"" whatever its people decide on independence, according to Ayrshire-born tycoon Sir Tom Hunter who is backing a fund to support entrepreneurial start-ups. Hunter is contributing £700,000 to a £3.2m fund also backed by the Royal Bank of to help an initiative set up by the Scottish government in 2012 continue until the end of 2017. It will offer grants and loans to businesses selected via a Dragons Den-style pitching process. ""There is a funding gap for these early stage businesses. The banks are not filling it and we can't expect them to do it as this is the riskiest part of finance,"" said Hunter. He believes the help is necessary because ""Scotland lags behind in terms of starting and growing businesses and that is an important part of economic progress."" But asked if things might be better under an independent Scotland Hunter said: ""I think that's a hard question to answer. It's a step into the unknown. Whatever the people decide we'll just get on with it. That's democracy."" Hunter has refused to reveal how he will vote in the referendum on whether Scotland should break away from the rest of the UK on 18 September. Instead he has funded a and ebook which collate information from experts on the pros and cons of independence. ""I'm not going to come down on one side, I am playing this straight. I'm not involved in any of the campaigns. For the past 25 years I have been banging the drum for helping Scottish businesses: this (fund) is part of that. If any side tried to make politicial gain out of it I would be very annoyed,"" he said. The new cash from Hunter and RBS will help develop the Scottish Edge fund which has so far support 69 start-up businesses. The Scottish government has already committed £2.35m to the project. But Hunter said that successful applicants would get more than just cash – they will also get advice and mentoring from experienced business people including him. Hunter has certainly seen both the highs and lows of entrepreneurial enterprise having made his name as Scotland's first billionaire after building up and selling on the retail chain Sports Division for a quarter of a million pounds before building a portfolio of property investments and stakes in a string of retailers including Wyevale Garden Centre and fashion chain USC and footwear store Office. But he lost an estimated quarter of his fortune during the financial crisis as several of those businesses got into financial difficulties. ""I made big mistakes and I take full responsibility. I was never on my knees but my pride took a hit and I'm now a bit poorer and a lot wiser,"" he says. ""Anybody who says the entrepreneurial journey is a straight curve upwards only is wrong. It's a roller coaster and if I couldn't deal with it myself then I wouldn't be much of a man."" Having made his name and much of his fortune from retail, the entrepreneur now doesn't own any store chains, having sold his stake in the House of Fraser department store to Newcastle United and Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley in a controversial move in April this year. Ashley still owns the 11% stake as the sale of the business to Chinese conglomerate Sanpower is yet to be finalised. The deal is thought to be awaiting Chinese regulatory approval. ""It was very straightforward. I checked if I could sell my shares, I could sell them and I got paid. The rest of the shareholders haven't got paid yet. There was a lot of talk about a legal wrangle but nothing ever came of it,"" said Hunter. His main investments now are in retail software company OrderDynamics as well as property investments including a portfolio floated on London's junior Aim market in June this year."	Business
307	308	EU contribution: Cameron will have to pay up, says Farage 	 has claimed that David Cameron will be forced to pay out an extra £1.7bn into the EU budget by the end of next month despite the government saying the extra demand was not acceptable. The Ukip leader’s comments, which he says is a reflection of Britain’s impotence in , will increase the pressure on the prime minister following Thursday night’s disclosure that Britain has been ordered to pay the money because its economy is performing better than other EU economies. A government source said the demand was “not acceptable”. It remained unclear on Friday morning whether the British government would challenge the EU demand in the courts,an option the Dutch government is reportedly exploring. But on an LBC radio phone-in on Friday morning, Farage said Cameron would have little option but to go along with the demand, which will have to be paid in December. “Of course he will pay up. These are the rules, the contributions to the was a very complex formula and part of it is a measurement of your GDP against everybody else’s. There’s nothing he can do,” he said. But prominent Tory critics of Europe continued to demand that Cameron makes a stand. Conservative backbencher John Redwood said the surcharge “offended all our principles of natural justice and fair taxation”. “It is a very large increase in tax on the British people charged retrospectively without their agreement,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme. He suggested the UK should simply refuse to pay the extra amount and that parliament should be asked to pass a law declaring the payment illegal. “The British people will not want to send another £1.7bn to the European Union by a very big majority and so the British government just says it won’t pay,” he said. Tory Eurosceptic Mark Pritchard said Cameron should consider bringing forward a referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU, which the prime minister has promised in 2017. British and European commission officials confirmed that the Treasury had been told last week that budget contribution calculations based on gross national income (GNI) adjustments carried out by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, had exposed a huge discrepancy between what Britain had been asked to contribute and what it should be paying, because of the UK’s recovery. The bombshell, , was dropped into the middle of an EU summit in Brussels where Cameron and 27 other leaders were mired in tough negotiations over climate-change policy and attempts to agree big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A Downing Street source said: “It’s not acceptable to just change the fees for previous years and demand them back at a moment’s notice. The European commission was not expecting this money and does not need this money and we will work with other countries similarly affected to do all we can to challenge this.” The prime minister on Thursday evening conferred with Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, as the Netherlands has also been ordered to pay more than €600m extra into the budget, while other countries such as Germany and France are likely to have excess contributions returned. The commission told the various countries of the revamped figures on 17 October, EU officials said. They said the British had until 1 December to provide €2.1bn, roughly a fifth of the UK’s annual net contribution to the EU. The demand for the money is political dynamite for a prime minister wrestling with dilemmas over Britain’s future in Europe and broadly seen to be making increasingly Eurosceptic gestures to the restless backbenchers who want to deal with Nigel Farage’s Europe rejectionists. “The timing is far from ideal,” said Patrizio Fiorilli, spokesman for the EU budget commissioner. “But there are rules we have to follow.” “It’s crazy,” said Richard Corbett, a Labour MEP and former senior EU official. “This must be an automatic thing because politically the timing could not be worse.” The request for the money comes as Cameron and his party, under pressure from Ukip to bolster their anti-EU credentials, are embroiled in fights with Brussels and other EU capitals over freedom of movement and immigration within the EU, and over Cameron’s insistence on rewriting the terms of Britain’s EU membership before putting a new deal to an in-out referendum by 2017 if he wins a second term next year. Cameron has set great store on campaigning to reduce the overall EU budget, arguing that at a time of austerity and spending cuts all across Europe, the Brussels pot could not remain immune. Eurostat arrived at the €2.1bn figure on the basis of new methods of calculating member states’ GNI since 1995, taking account of previously unreported or under-reported black economy elements, such as drug-dealing and consumption or the sex industry. Eurostat concluded that the UK economy has been doing much better than previously assumed since 1995, relative to other European countries, and that British contributions needed to be upped. “It changes the way contributions to the budget are calculated,” said Fiorilli. “Some member states have booming economies. Everyone can see the UK is growing much faster than others.” Fiorilli said that the commission and Eurostat use 1995 as the benchmark year for calculating the impact of GNI figures. “Member states including Britain insisted on this. It is their decision,” he said. The demand comes as part of what is known in Brussels as an amending budget proposal, a routine event that occurs regularly and is dependent on the ebb and flow of payments into the EU machine. There are a further six amending budgets on the table in Brussels, some of which may entail returning funds to Britain, meaning the overall bill could yet be cut. While the €2.1bn bill is theoretically due by 1 December, the amending budget also has to be endorsed by the 28 governments of the EU and by the European parliament, meaning it could run into resistance if Britain is able to marshal enough allies and given that there are many European governments reluctant to hand an easy victory to those campaigning to take the UK out of the EU.

13635	13636	Hugo Lloris signs new five-year contract with Tottenham Hotspur 	France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has signed a new five-year contract with Tottenham. The 27-year-old joined the North London club from Lyon two summers ago. A statement on Spurs’ website read: “We are delighted to announce that Hugo Lloris has committed his future to the club with the signing of a new five-year contract.” “I spoke with the chairman [Daniel Levy] and I know the club is as ambitious as ever,” said Lloris. “It’s very important to feel at home at a club and for my family to feel well. I enjoy a great relationship with the club and the fans. “The arrival of Mauricio Pochettino is important as well. I have a good feeling with him. He is also ambitious. “Everything is clear in my head and if I’ve signed a new contract it’s because I trust the club and I’m sure we will progress in a positive way. “Last season wasn’t the season we all hoped for but we were still able to finish sixth in the league. We know where we have to improve, the club also knows and there is a feeling and a confident connection between the club and the players.” Lloris has made 78 appearances for Tottenham since joining for €10m from Lyon, potentially rising to €15m (£8m rising to £12m).

1041	1042	US jobs dip quells fears of interest rate increase 	"Fears of an early rise in US interest rates were eased on Friday by weaker than expected jobs data, helping to pull global markets out of the tailspin they had endured in another volatile week of trading. But despite a recovery from their worst levels, shares still recorded a second day of declines. Both the UK and US markets have now fallen into negative territory for the year, after testing new highs not so long ago. Stronger than expected US growth figures on Wednesday, which showed second quarter GDP up 4% on an annualised basis, along with hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve board member Charles Plosser, had prompted fears that the central bank may increase the cost of borrowing sooner than expected. Plosser objected to the guidance in the Fed's latest statement saying interest rates would remain low ""for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends"". At the current rate, the monthly bond buying would be finished before the end of the year. But Friday's non-farm payroll numbers from the US showed 209,000 jobs were created in July, lower than the bumper 298,000 the previous month and fewer than forecasts of about 230,000. This was the sixth consecutive month of 200,000 plus employment growth, the first time this has happened since 1997. But the unemployment rate rose unexpectedly from 6.1% to 6.2%, while average earnings, a figure carefully watched by the Fed for its inflationary impact, were flat at 2% year on year compared to expectations of 2.3%. These slightly weaker than expected numbers suggested the Fed would be in no rush to raise rates from their current level of close to zero, and gave some support to battered share prices. James Knightley at ING Bank said: ""As the pool of available labour continues to shrink we will see wages respond positively and inflation pressures within the economy will build. Consequently, we look for the Federal Reserve's commentary to gradually shift in the months ahead and favour a rate hike early in the second quarter of 2015."" Sean Lynch at Wells Fargo bank told Reuters: ""The worry was that bad news would be bad for the market and good news would be bad for the market and we came right down the middle with this report. It still points to a job market and an economy that is improving, but we also have the absence of wage pressures building which [was] becoming another concern for investors."" Markets have suffered a turbulent few days, hit by a combination of rate rise concerns and growing geopolitical worries. The week saw Argentina defaulting for the second time in 12 years, while continuing tensions with Russia over the Ukraine led to the imposition of further sanctions which could hit businesses and put the brakes on global growth. According to Reuters, about 40 European blue-chip companies derive more than 5% of their revenues from the Russian market. The violence in Gaza also added to the sense of events escalating out of control. In Europe the troubled Portuguese bank Espirito Santo reported a quarterly loss of €3.6bn (£2.8bn), prompting talk of a possible emergency fundraising or state bailout and leading to its shares being suspended. The losses revived worries about possible contagion in the rest of the eurozone banking sector. There were also mixed July manufacturing figures on Friday, with US and Chinese manufacturing moving ahead but the UK and eurozone PMI surveys coming in below expectations. But following the US jobs figures, markets came off their worst levels. The 100 finished down 50.93 points at 6679.18 on Friday, having fallen as low as 6624. That was still a three day loss of nearly 130 points. In Europe, Germany's Dax dropped 2% while France's Cac closed down 1%. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 97 points or 0.6% on Friday, hitting a one week low although strong earnings from companies including Sony limited the damage. Meanwhile in the US the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down around 55 points by the time London closed. On Thursday the US index slumped more than 300 points – its worst daily performance since February – which wiped out all the gains made so far this year. It was only two weeks ago that the Dow hit a record high as the global economy seemed to be recovering and the withdrawal of central bank stimulus seemed to be proceeding according to plan. In the foreign exchange markets, the dollar slipped back against a basket of currencies as the prospect of US rate rise receded."	Business
1226	1227	Lights, camera, quick backflip: the eloquence of silent films 	"od knows how many films I've seen in my life (about one a day is my average), but I've seldom witnessed such a receptive audience as I did for the other week. Memories of all the silent films I watched during my childhood came swinging back to me; looking around, the rest of the cinema seemed to bask in a similarly rapt and innocent haze of pleasure. When it was over, they clapped as they would at the end of an exceptionally good play. Of all the many strengths of Michel Hazanavicius's film, the absence of words is the greatest. No words means no reliance on a form of communication that isn't, in fact, anything like as effective as we think. The language of gesture often says more – and it's always more passionate. It's obvious but easy to forget, even though we wonder every day why our exchanges by text and email seem so tinny and thin, why they fail to convey friendship, love or just plain amiability as warmly as we would like. Think of the reckless physicality with which the truly great movie stars put their stories across: Cary Grant, interrupting a polite compliment with a backflip in , just for emphasis. Or 's backbone, coiled like a spring as she swoops down to suck the breath from her lover's mouth as though it were honey. Or 's menacing waddle: is he an American hero or a crusty old curmudgeon? He's not letting on, and that's the point. Think of the mockingly girlish delicacy of Brando, or Monroe as she sashays down the side of the train in . Modern screen acting can seem very cerebral by comparison, and also rather corporate, as if having anything too interesting going on might upset the customers. While researching , about an eastern European immigrant who becomes a major player in Hollywood's golden age, I came across the autobiography of  , one of the founders of the British film industry. Hepworth recalled, at the age of 21, dashing up to the top-floor London workshop of the inventor Robert W Paul, the man who pioneered the projection of moving pictures on to screens in Britain. He wanted to sell the great man his newly invented electric lamp, and found himself clambering over a dozen or more Polish and Armenian Jews asleep on the stairs. These were travelling showmen, waiting for Paul's latest projectors to be delivered, so they could go back home and dazzle the peasants of the wide-flung shtetls, the Jewish communities of eastern Europe, with the wonders of cinema. I realised how deeply cinema had taken root in Yiddish popular culture before the first world war. And then how profoundly Yiddish culture had influenced American film, as the Hollywood movie moguls, almost all of them Jewish immigrants, transformed the plays, vaudeville acts, folk tales and sentimental musical comedies they remembered from the old country into an American art form. They then presented it, in true democratic fashion, coast to coast, in palatial theatres glowing with chandeliers and marble staircases, to rich and poor alike for a mere 25 cents admission. What were the stories these moguls told? Girl meets boy, they lose each other, they get back together. Corny? Sure, but that's how it is in peasant life and, come to think of it, that's how it is everywhere else. What else? A mixed-up young man clashes with his traditionally minded parents: a perennial theme in Jewish literature, as the cultural gap between city and shtetl grew wider. Any movie examples? Too many to count. And a popular tale from 19th-century Yiddish pulp fiction: a shtetl plagued by crooks and assassins is rescued by a man of exceptional courage who draws his gun and drives the baddies away. That's right: High Noon is a Jewish movie. The first talking film was , paradoxically not really a talkie at all, but a glorious silent-and-talkie piece of Yiddish schmaltz: after that, silent movies were dead. But my cinema-buff uncle Geoff, a stalwart of the Cape Town Film Society, went on showing them to my family throughout my childhood. Not all of them were as good as they were cracked up to be. The I found faintly malodorous: all those tacky moonbound trains and weird homunculi – and weren't the illusions merely stop-go camerawork? Even I could work that out, and I was only six. Chaplin was fine as long as he was funny; when he simpered, I blushed and looked away. Buster Keaton's cool and classical style was a lot more like it. , even in a tattered old print, was astonishing, and hypnotic in its beauty. I remember my mother's voice ringing through the darkness: ""Should Nicky really be watching this?"" I'm glad I did. Travelling Light, a new play by Nicholas Wright, opens on 18 January at the National , London SE1, nationaltheatre.org.uk. There will be a live cinema broadcast on 9 February"	Film
4041	4042	Government borrowing edges up in February 	"A rise in local authority borrowing pushed up the government deficit by £9.3bn last month, but left George Osborne's deficit reduction plan on track, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics said that for the first 11 months of the 2013/14 financial year borrowing was down £4.4bn on the same months last year to £99.3bn. Coming days after the chancellor said the public finances would be in surplus by 2018-19, the latest monthly data showed the Treasury remains on course to hit its borrowing target of £107.8bn when the financial year ends in April. Osborne said better than expected growth in the next couple of years would close the public spending deficit – the difference between tax income and government spending – at a faster rate than predicted last year. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the figures represented mixed news for . He said the underlying improvement in February was undermined by comparison with February 2013, when the shortfall was limited by a £2.3bn transfer from the sale of 4G mobile phone licences. ""To meet his revised PSNBR [public sector net borrowing requirement] target of £107.8bn in 2013-14, the chancellor now needs the shortfall to come in at £8.5bn in March. This may prove difficult to achieve, given that there was a deficit of £11.4bn in March 2013,"" he said."" ""If the chancellor immediately just misses his newly set targets for 2013-14, it could increase scepticism that the chancellor will achieve his fiscal targets further out. The latest public finances highlight the fact that there is still an awfully long way to go in getting the public finances into decent shape."" Analysts dismissed the rise in council borrowing, saying it was a figure that would normally be spread over several months, but said concerns remained that cuts in public sector spending relied on . Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said it was worrying that tax receipts were still not responding to the economic recovery as positively as might have been hoped."

3614	3615	Melancholia – review 	"oody Allen once said: ""If I had to live my life again I'd do everything the same, except that I wouldn't see ."" By the same token, if I was told that the end of the world was nigh, I wouldn't waste my time seeing , Lars von Trier's celebration of the imminent extinction of planet Earth. I'd do something more pleasurable like taking an axe to a cigarette machine and smoking my first fag for 40 years, an activity I still associate with movie-going. However, I did nearly end my own life last Tuesday by the exertion entailed in walking from the eastern side of Covent Garden to the western end of Soho in 10 minutes, due to the distributors' bad planning of the press viewings. Breathing what seemed like my last, I slumped down a couple of minutes into the apocalyptic prologue of . Fortunately I'd read that this highly stylised pre-credit sequence introduced the principal characters and presented a collision between the wandering planet and our own, resulting in a one-nil victory for the visitors. A younger critic kindly stayed behind to describe in some detail what I might have missed, even telling me that there was a reference he knew I'd have noticed to . What then followed was two chapters named ""Justine"" and ""Claire"" after the sisters at its centre, who view each other with mutual loathing. Like most of von Trier's films since he burst on the international scene at the 1984 Cannes festival with , is in English rather than his native Danish, though it doesn't seem remotely like a British or American picture, despite the appearance of familiar English-speaking actors among the assorted Scandinavians. Moreover, like his oeuvre as a whole, it is, to quote the most famous, most melancholy of Danes, ""sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought"". Indeed like Hamlet, von Trier is a depressed, attention-seeking malcontent, forever insulting and playing malevolent games with those around him and inventing dramas such as Hamlet's ""The Mousetrap"", designed to disturb and expose the audience and leave it in a state of disarray. The film is set in an unnamed country at a remote chateau where Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her husband arrive two hours late for their elegant wedding reception, hosted by sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her rich, tight-fisted husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). This blighted event, where everyone is at each other's throats, backbiting and bloodletting, is clearly reminiscent of Thomas Vinterberg's , the most celebrated of movies to come out of the much publicised Dogme movement that von Trier launched in the 1990s and imposed upon his Danish contemporaries. There are also echoes of Elsinore, of Marienbad, of a Sadean orgy (through the name Justine), and of the wedding reception in (Justine's father, played by , is called Dexter after CK Dexter Haven, the charming philanderer impersonated by Cary Grant in George Cukor's film). In an amusing and diverting way, the wilful, depressed Justine behaves appallingly, leaving and rejoining the party as she pleases. She urinates on a green on the surrounding golf course, has sex with a young stranger in a bunker, insults the best man (Stellan Skarsgård) who is both her new father-in-law and her employer at an advertising agency. But the carefully orchestrated festivities continue unabashed. Like the partygoers in Buñuel's , the wedding guests refuse to acknowledge the impending catastrophe. Meanwhile, the soaring romantic strains of Wagner's on the soundtrack direct us to Eliot's and to thoughts of luxuriant death. The film's second half is much more like a conventional disaster movie, both of the art-house (eg Tarkovsky's ) and Hollywood (eg Stanley Kramer's ) variety. Now alone and isolated on the grand country estate, Claire, John, their young son, Leo, and Justine confront, affect to confront or merely witness the approaching Melancholia which from once being a distant speck is now emerging over the horizon like some beautiful leviathan. Claire lays into suicide pills. The rational amateur astronomer John assures everyone that the danger will pass. Leo views the planet as another marvel of nature. Justine, however, emerging from her torpor to discover a new composure, seems to welcome the collision as bringing a fitting end to an evil, isolated, unnecessary world. At one eloquent point she rearranges a display of art books in the chateau's library to give prominence to reproductions of Edward Burne-Jones's and several Bruegel paintings, among them the chilly . There are a few striking images here, especially of the sisters out riding on fine horses, observed from a high angle through an early-morning mist. But the movie is heavy, though without weight or gravitas – a solipsistic, narcissistic, inhuman affair. And it is wholly devoid of humour, except perhaps for the meeting towards the end of Claire and Justine: the game is over and they're at a golf hole bearing a flag apocalyptically marked ""19"". Superficially, resembles Terrence Malick's e in its apparent engagement with big spiritual issues and matters eschatological, but it lacks Malick's emotional generosity."	Film
1660	1661	Magic in the Moonlight review – a Woody vehicle with serious engine trouble 	agic in the Moonlight isn’t Woody Allen’s worst film – that is still probably , from 2002 – but it’s still desperately disappointing after the glorious triumph that was , last year’s Oscar-winning smash about the cantankerous bankrupt socialite, played by Cate Blanchett. That was authentic Woody Allen, the real deal. There is, on the other hand, something unreal and absent about this lacklustre 1920s period picture, which clunks and clanks along on autopilot, with vague borrowings from PG Wodehouse, Agatha Christie and indeed Woody Allen’s own earlier work. Here, his male and female leads take romantic cover from a storm in an observatory: a throwback to the rainswept Woody and Diane Keaton rushing into the planetarium in Manhattan. Like the period automobile roadster that at one point in the film breaks down, this movie has some pretty serious engine trouble. Or maybe the problem is that it has no engine to speak of. There are strained performances, weird empty stretches where the gags are supposed to go and some frankly very uncertain line-readings. Set against this are moments of delicacy and absurd charm, all but drowned in the film’s heavy, flavourless stew. is cast, or typecast, or miscast, as the stuffy and conceited fellow destined to fall, Darcy-ishly, for the woman of whom he very much disapproves. He is Stanley, a British professional magician who performs in the hokey Oriental stage persona of Wei Ling Soo (a name that sounds as if it is some cheeky pun, but isn’t, unless Wailing Sue counts) with silly flowing robes, fake drooping moustache and bald cap. As well as being a magician, Stanley is an atheist and rationalist, a crusading debunker of all the fraudsters and phoney seance-hucksters preying on the rich and credulous in the jazz age. One summer, Stanley ventures to the south of France, dead set on taking down a supposed spiritualist called Sophie (Emma Stone) whose apparent powers are dazzling fashionable society on the Côte d’Azur; these wealthy chumps are getting out their cheque books to fund a supposed spiritual research foundation being set up by Sophie and her hard-faced mamma (Marcia Gay Harden). But Sophie’s extraordinary telepathic abilities and beauty leave Stanley stunned. Could magic – and the magic of love – be more real than he thought? Magic has always played an important role in Woody Allen’s work, but it has always tended to be real magic. Kugelmass really can transport himself into Madame Bovary in his short story The Kugelmass Episode; characters really can come down from the screen in The Purple Rose of Cairo; Leonard really does transform, chameleon-like, to become like the people he’s talking to. In Magic in the Moonlight, Stanley wonders, dumbstruck, about the seductive or dangerous possibilities of something he anachronistically calls “magical thinking”, but Allen has long ago proved himself a master of this kind of thinking with his inspired fantasies: the prerogative of both fiction and comedy. This is a different type of story about magic, and there is no reason why a rationalist movie about tricks shouldn’t be as light and soufflé-ish as everything else. But Firth’s character is just so boorish and monotonous, charmless and unrelaxed. He’s presumably supposed to be as airy and debonair as Cary Grant. Instead, he glowers like Gordon Brown. The problem is not deciding to laugh at him or with him, it’s finding any occasion for laughter at all. Well, the mechanics of the country house mystery in which Stanley finds himself provide some amusement, and there is some diversion to be had in the final revelation. Perhaps going to a new Woody Allen film is now the nearest thing audiences in the 21st century can have to seeing a run-of-the-mill prewar studio picture. We idolise and fetishise the great pictures from this period and forget about the fact that the dream factory churned out an awful lot of dross as well as the gold. The sheer volume of production is what increased the likelihood of excellence and this allows posterity to pick and choose the classics and forget the rest. It’s the same with . With remarkable and undimmed stamina, he just keeps making movies and I now think it’s beside the point for critics (like me) to complain about his workrate. This is his creative style. Even at its lowest ebb it still produces moments of interest. And it is capable of throwing out something like Blue Jasmine. It might still do in the future. So I am not complaining.	Film
3241	3242	TPP trade deadlock: Pacific countries near deal after biotech breakthrough 	A dozen Pacific countries have closed in on a sweeping free trade pact after a breakthrough over how long a monopoly pharmaceutical companies should be given on new biotech drugs. The issue has pitted the US, which argued for longer protections, and five other delegations which said such measures would strain national healthcare budgets and keep life-saving medicines from patients who cannot afford them. However, as befitting for negotiations that have been going on for five years, plans to announce the deal at the talks in Atlanta, Georgia on Sunday night were delayed. The last-minute hitch was caused by New Zealand’s insistence on greater access to overseas markets for its dairy exports, people involved in the talks said. “The thing that’s missing is (an agreement) on dairy market access,” one official said. US officials said a joint news conference had been postponed until early on Monday. The compromise on medicines thrashed in Atlanta would preserve Australia’s existing five-year protection period but would also offer flexibility on longer drug monopolies, potentially creating two tracks on future drug pricing within the trading bloc, a person close to the negotiations said. The terms of that compromise, hammered out after a third all-night round of negotiations between Australia and the US, still had to find support from other nations such as Chile and Peru, other people involved in the talks said. Mexican economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said he could not reveal details of the compromise on biologics “until everyone has signed up and we are all on the same page”. But officials were increasingly confident of completing a deal that has been in negotiations for five years. Japan’s economy minister, Akira Amari, said he had called Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to notify him that a deal was within sight. The US offers 12 years of exclusivity for the clinical data used in developing drugs like cancer therapy Avastin, developed by Genentech, a division of Roche, in order to encourage innovation. Australia insisted on five years of protection to bring down drug prices more quickly. The trade pact – the Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP – would lower tariffs and set common standards for 12 economies led by the US and Japan, which together account for 40% of global output. President Obama has pushed for a deal as a way to open markets to US exports, including financial services and pharmaceuticals. US officials have also promoted the deal as a counterweight to China and that rising power’s vision for Asia. The talks in Atlanta were extended by 24 hours to a fifth day on Sunday. A handful of protesters unfurled a “Stop TPP” banner at the Westin hotel, where the talks were taking place, on Sunday morning. They were escorted away by security and police. By Saturday, the US and Japan had reached agreement in principle on trade in autos and auto parts in talks that also included Canada and Mexico. That agreement is expected to give US automakers, led by General Motors and Ford, two decades or more of tariff protection against low-cost pickup truck imports from Thailand or elsewhere in Asia, people briefed on the talks have said. But the TPP deal taking shape would also give Japan’s auto industry, led by Toyota, a freer hand to source parts from Asia, including from plants outside the TPP-zone, like China, for vehicles sold in North America. A “rule of origin” would stipulate that only 45% of a vehicle would have to be sourced from within the TPP, down from the equivalent ratio of 62.5% under Nafta, officials have said. New Zealand wants to ensure its dairy industry, dominated by Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter, comes out as a clear winner in a TPP deal by opening markets like Canada, Mexico, Japan and the United States. If US trade representative Michael Froman, chair of the Atlanta talks, manages to steer them to a conclusion on Sunday, that would mark the start of a political fight to get the deal approved in the US. The Obama administration relied on Republican votes to win fast-track trade negotiating authority from Congress in July, setting up a straight yes or no vote on any deal. Many Democrats and labour groups have raised questions about what the TPP would mean for jobs in manufacturing and environmental protections. Republicans, including Senator Orrin Hatch, the powerful chairman of the Senate finance committee, have urged the administration to hold the line on intellectual property protections, including for biologic drugs.

10177	10178	Women fare better in independent films than in Hollywood, study finds 	"Female directors remain woefully underrepresented in Hollywood but , according to a new study commissioned by the Sundance film festival and Women in Film. The survey found that there has been little change in the gender balance at Robert Redford's annual showcase of indie film-making in Park City, Utah over the past decade. (This year, however, male and female directors are equally represented at the festival, which kicked off on Thursday and runs until Sunday.) Overall, women represented fewer than one-third of the 11,000 directors, writers, producers, cinematographers and editors working on the 820 narrative and documentary films that have appeared at Sundance since 2002. ""There has been no sustained or meaningful change across the last 11 years in the percentage of [female] directors or producers at the ,"" said Stacy L Smith of the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, which carried out the survey. Sundance still does far better than the mainstream film-making sphere, however. Over the same period only 4.4% of the top-grossing Hollywood films were directed by women, and a remarkable 40% of these had come through programmes organised by the Sundance Institute. The study also found that female film-makers are more likely to employ other women on their productions. Separate studies have found that female directors are more likely to feature women or girls on screen, and the subject matter for their films is likely to be less violent and feature fewer guns and less blood and gore. The Sundance survey found that women were better represented in the factual film-making sphere: they made up almost half of documentary directors at Sundance since 2002. Organisers hope to use the results of the study to create mentoring and support programmes to increase the number of women working behind the camera in US film-making. Gender disparity in film-making has long been an issue but raised its head firmly above the parapet at last year's Cannes film festival after it emerged that . Organisers later apologised for the oversight following strident criticism from French feminists and critics."	Film
3532	3533	Andy Burnham says Labour will end NHS 'fast-track' privatisation 	"A government will repeal the coalition's controversial healthcare legislation in the first year of taking power, the party's health spokesman has declared. In a barnstorming speech, greeted by whoops and cheers, to party delegates at Labour's annual conference, said that the Tory-led coalition's health reforms had placed the NHS on a fast-track to fragmentation and privatisation and that the legislation had to go. Internally there has been a debate within the party about whether these populist measures could be easily implemented. Critics point out that Tory and Liberal Democrat peers will control the Lords and would almost certainly block attempts to roll back dramatically a key coalition policy – especially if Labour ended up seeking Nick Clegg's support to run the country. However, Burnham made clear that in ""the first Queen's speech of the next Labour government we will repeal the act"". Despite the bravura performance, Burnham did not receive effusive support from Ed Miliband during the question-and-answer session that followed shadow cabinet speeches. When a delegate asked the Labour leader not to move Burnham in the presumed forthcoming reshuffle, Miliband declined to back Burnham personally, saying that he was ""four-square behind Andy's ideas"". Burnham said the coalition's plans were built upon competition and privatisation, but Labour would offer a national health and care service, based on people before profits. He said this would mean ""whole-person care"", effectively bringing together the hospitals, mental health services and social care. Burnham announced that 25 councils, of differing political persuasions, had already agreed to road-test the idea. He also proposed that the NHS would have one named contact to co-ordinate the care of elderly patients, who were being driven towards hospital in ever greater numbers because of the failure to support them, he said. This would mean, he said, ""known care staff going with [patients] on to the ward"". There had been, in the last two years, a 66% increase in the number of people aged 90 or more entering A&E departments via blue-light ambulances, Burnham said. ""That's 100,000 very frail and frightened people in the backs of ambulances speeding through our cities and towns."" But the Tories suggested that Burnham's plans would be expensive. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, warned that repealing the bill would cost the taxpayer £5.5bn a year, with another £20bn required to create a national care service. However, Burnham claimed the NHS was being privatised with huge private health firms run by people who had donated £1.5m to the Tories, winning £1.5bn in NHS contracts. He also said that savings were being made by forcing the NHS to restrict patient treatment, a policy that would necessitate people having to pay hospitals for care. In October 2012 hospitals were given the right to generate 49% of their income from private patients. Labour said freedom of information requests to hospitals had revealed a significant increase in income generated from private work in the first year of the new arrangements. In 2012/13, hospitals generated £434m, an additional £47m on 2010/11. The NHS trusts projected that this would increase by a further £45m to £479m this year. The move to make money from patients comes as Burnham claimed that one in seven GP commissioners – those who buy care on behalf of patients – had introduced new treatment restrictions. Labour advised that this was growing evidence that some patients were being unfairly denied access to vital treatments. In his speech Burnham said: ""Thousands of older people denied cataract, hip and knee operations simply because of where they live – a postcode lottery running riot. And get ready for the next scandal. NHS hospitals, pushed by David Cameron to earn half their income from private patients, charging for beds left empty by these restrictions."" The hard-hitting words clearly pleased the Labour activists at conference. Such support will be crucial for Burnham, whose position in his present post has been called in question after about the party's need to be bolder."	Politics
8748	8749	RBS chairman makes plea as £2bn loss is announced 	" pleaded to be treated as a fully commercial business as it confirmed it is paying out £785m in bonuses despite recording another loss – of £2bn – last year. As the bank announced the fourth consecutive year of losses since its October 2008 bailout, chairman Sir Philip Hampton argued that it needed to be run on ""commercial grounds"" if taxpayers were to get their £45bn investment repaid. The state is currently sitting on a £20bn loss on its 82% stake, despite the shares rising 5% to 28.2p. Even as the bank insisted that bonuses were down and attempted to show restraint by imposing salary freezes on its 17,000 investment bankers and other high-paid staff, union officials were furious at 1% salary rises for branch staff who will not share in the £390m investment banking bonus pool. The retail arm recorded a jump in profits and David Fleming, Unite national officer, accused the bank of ""hypocrisy"". ""The bonus pot would give these low-paid employees approximately £6,000, which amounts to simply loose change for a City slicker,"" Fleming said. Rival bailed out bank Lloyds Group will also report losses on Friday and face a potential row over pay if it discloses a golden hello for new finance director George Culmer, who is to join in May. RBS insisted average pay for investment bankers had fallen 26% from £152,000 to £112,000 although calculations of average staff costs inside the investment bank showed they had remained steady at £144,000 despite a 54% fall in operating profit to £1.5bn. The compensation to income ratio – which shows how much revenue is used to pay staff – rose to 41% from 34% and the Association of British Insurers argued that the ""figures make it difficult to judge"" how far RBS was sharing the spoils between employees, shareholders and to strengthen its financial position. Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, accused the chancellor of doing ""nothing to change the excessive bonus culture that continues to roll on and on"". The average investment banking bonus was £22,941, more than 50% lower than £50,114 a year ago, while the bonus pool for the 146,000 staff across the group was £795m. For accounting purposes the ""variable compensation"" was £985m. Chief executive Stephen Hester said his colleagues should not hand their bonuses back as he did – and warned the ""noise"" around RBS was damaging. ""You can't have your cake and eat it,"" said Hester. ""If you want an RBS that is mired in the past, a British Leyland, then we should be judged on a different basis,"" Hester said. He defended the investment bank, saying that without the £10bn of profits it had generated in the past three years another taxpayer bailout would have been needed. The £45bn bailout had been enough to keep the bank afloat but not to cover the £42bn of clean up charges incurred so far, paid for out of £33bn of operating profits, Hester said as he described an an ""Alice in Wonderland"" world in which bigger losses were proof of success as the bank wound down its balance sheet. Some £10bn of the clean-up bill comes from Ulster Bank's bad property loans. Ministers lined up in support of the pay deals, as did UK Financial Investments which controls the taxpayer stake. George Osborne said RBS was""cleaning up the mess after the biggest bank bailout in history"" and that ""bonuses at the investment bank are less than half what they were last year and less than a third of what they were in 2009"". Hampton admitted that ministers had been warned by ""many sources"" about the impact of anti-business rhetoric and not just on RBS. Hester revised down targets for return on equity from 15% to 12% but stressed that many other targets he set when he took the helm three years ago had been achieved, such as reducing the balance sheet by £700bn – which he described as twice the size of Greece's debt."

8126	8127	George Osborne accused of con trick over £1.7bn EU bill 	 did not raise a single complaint about Britain’s £1.7bn EU backdated bill and did not manage to get a single penny off the total, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has said. Balls said it was a con trick that took the British people for fools, after the chancellor claimed to have reduced the bill to £850m at an EU meeting on Friday by negotiating to make sure the UK’s rebate applied. Balls also joked that he could barely see John Bercow, the Speaker, for all Osborne’s “fog and bluster”, because it was always obvious that the UK would get its usual discount on the bill. A from the European budget commissioner on 27 October proves the rebate was always going to apply and was never in doubt, Balls said. Addressing the chancellor, Balls said: “Isn’t the truth the chancellor has failed to reduce our contribution by a single penny? “All he is doing is simply counting the rebate that was due anyway, a rebate that was never in doubt, trying to fool people into thinking the bill has been halved. His so-called victory is nothing more than a con trick.” He said minutes from the EU meeting showed Osborne did not object to the bill and questioned Treasury claims that the chancellor had received legal advice casting doubt on whether the rebate would be applied. But Osborne pointed out that Balls did not mention the application of the discount when the latter, in an , set out the sum that the UK would have to pay, along with interest payments based on the £1.7bn total. Posing in the Commons with a copy of the newspaper, the chancellor said it was “not clear” before the meeting that the rebate would apply, reducing the total to £850m. “If it was the case that was always going to apply, why was it not mentioned before?” he said. Osborne said the UK’s bill had been halved from £1.7bn, had been delayed until 2015-16 and would include no interest. The chancellor was backed by supportive Tory MPs. But the pro-Europe former cabinet minister Ken Clarke cast doubt on the idea that the chancellor had won a great battle. He said it was a “surprisingly good” deal but probably the result of a friendly chat rather than “gunfight at the OK Corral”.	Politics
3744	3745	Labour extends lead over Tories to 11 points, according to new poll 	 has stretched its lead over the Tories to 11 points, according to a new Opinium/Observer poll. The poll puts Labour on 38%, the Conservatives on 27%, and the on 9%. The Tories have dropped four points in two weeks, and David Cameron's personal popularity is now almost on a par with that of . That will be a particular tonic for the Labour leader, who has consistently suffered in comparisons with Cameron. According to the poll, 33% of respondents approve of Cameron, and 51% disapprove. That compares with 25% who approve of Miliband, and 44% who disapprove. Opinium Research has also carried out polling on the public's attitude to free schools. Last week the row over the al-Madinah free school in Derby continued after Ofsted found the school dysfunctional and teachers claimed they were forced to wear a hijab. Despite the headlines, 44% of likely voters in England think free schools are generally a good thing, while 22% think they're a bad thing. However, 60% are concerned about free schools hiring teachers who may not have a PGCE or equivalent, while 30% are not. Views on the future of free schools are fairly mixed. Nearly a quarter (23%) think they should continue as they are, while 27% think they should continue only if there is a shortage of places in local schools and all teachers have a PGCE or equivalent. One in five believe that free schools should no longer be funded and existing ones should be taken under local authority control.

12162	12163	Steven Gerrard vows to return to Liverpool in the future 	 has pledged to return to Liverpool because he feels he has a contribution to make to the club in the future. The 34-year-old is enjoying a post-season break before he begins a new challenge in Major League Soccer with Los Angeles Galaxy this summer. But after 710 appearances in a 17-year professional career at Anfield, Gerrard has his sights set on coming back. “I’ve been a supporter all my life and that will continue,” he wrote in an open letter to fans in the Echo. “I hope to get the opportunity to come back and serve the club again one day. I feel that I can make a contribution in some role in the future.” Gerrard has been captain for more than a decade and led from the front in most of the club’s recent successes, most famously . However, this season he has not featured as regularly as he would have liked and that persuaded him a move to the United States would help prolong his playing career despite a contract offer coming in late from the Reds. “I want to keep playing every week in the final few years of my career and I’m looking forward to embarking on a new challenge with Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS,” he added. “It’s been an absolute privilege to represent this football club for so long. It’s been very humbling and it’s something I’ll cherish for the rest of my life. “People have often asked me about the pressure on my shoulders to deliver for Liverpool but I’ve never seen that as a burden. It’s been a massive honour to be captain of this club for so long. I’ve always given my best and tried to lead by example.” He added: “But today is all about looking back and saying thank you to the fans for the magnificent support you have given me over the past two decades. You have helped me to fulfil my dreams over and over again and given me memories I wouldn’t swap for anything.”	Football

7668	7669	Harman seeks to end Labour row with ‘reasoned amendment’ to welfare bill 	Labour’s interim leader, , has tried to defuse a rebellion over welfare by tabling an amendment setting out why the party disagrees with the government’s proposed bill, but suggesting that Labour MPs abstain rather than vote against. Labour has been plagued by infighting since Harman that the party would not block the bill but would instead try to amend parts of it at committee stage. The decision to table a “reasoned amendment” came after Helen Goodman, the MP for Bishop Auckland, tabled a backbench amendment opposing the bill. It also followed further talks with the new intake of MPs on Wednesday night and again with at least 10 shadow cabinet ministers on Thursday. The amendment, setting out why the bill should be rejected, was put forward by Harman in an effort to prevent the party from splitting on an issue that has been made more difficult as leadership candidates try to signal their positions while retaining collective shadow cabinet responsibility. The frontrunner for the leadership, , this week called for the party to oppose the welfare bill if a reasoned amendment was defeated. Burnham met Harman on Thursday afternoon and is understood to be pleased that such a motion is being proposed, but his aides refused to disclose whether he would then oppose the bill rather than abstain, if the amendment was defeated. Aides to , the shadow home secretary and a leadership rival to Burnham, also said she clearly opposed the bill, but insisted they would not brief on how the party should vote if the amendment is defeated. Another shadow cabinet meeting may be needed to thrash out a final position after party whips have taken further soundings. An already-demoralised party can hardly afford a big split on welfare with different leadership candidates voting different ways. Any divisions will be exploited by George Osborne, who is intent on portraying as the party of welfare as opposed to a Conservative party committed to work. Harman at the weekend said Labour needed to wake up and understand the reasons for its defeat, including public rejection of the party’s stance on the economy and welfare. She said abstention on the welfare bill would be a signal that the party was prepared to change. Her stance led to a rebellion in the parliamentary party, and she clearly hopes she has crafted a compromise that sets out the party’s reasoned differences with the government without lapsing into a blanket opposition that gives the impression Labour is not willing to reflect and change. The reasoned amendment calls for controls on and reforms to the overall costs of social security and supports the proposed reporting obligations on full employment, apprenticeships and troubled families in the bill as well as a benefits cap and loans for mortgage interest support. But it says the house should not give the bill a second reading since it would “prevent the government from continuing to pursue an ambition to reduce child poverty in both absolute and relative terms”. Harman will also propose that the party go out and listen to the public on welfare reform, including on the proposal that tax credits should only be provided to the first two children. She retains her position that the party needs to recognise that many people in work, and not on tax credits, limit their family size for financial reasons and will resent it if they believe the same financial constraints are not being placed on those on benefits. Helen Goodman, the leader of the backbench rebels, said she welcomed Harman’s decision to table an amendment but added: “I cannot see why if you table a reasoned amendment rejecting a bill you would then go onto abstain in a further vote on the bill. It would be best to oppose all the way through because of the damage the bill does to people in poverty.” Harman’s stance has created tensions in the context of the Labour leadership election with some Burnham supporters believing she was trying to portray him as an opponent of reform. But she is understood to feel strongly that she consulted the relevant shadow cabinet colleagues and insists she has no other motive than reflecting a recognition of the public mood. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign, still surging in terms of constituency nominations, hit trouble when one of his prominent young supporters claimed if Corbyn won he would have to act swiftly to purge staff at the party headquarters and bring the parliamentary party into line. Max Shanly, a Corbyn supporter on the national committee of Young Labour and active in Unite, saying: “I think Jeremy will face problems not just inside the parliamentary Labour party, which I think is likely to split if he wins with the Blairites buggering off to form a new SDP, but also from the Labour party bureaucracy. New Labourism is still a hegemonic force at Brewers Green (Labour Party HQ) and despite having resigned as leader eight years ago, Blair is still the piper who plays the tune many party staff listen to. “The Labour left will have to act swiftly and I am afraid brutally in many cases. The PLP will have to be brought into line, some members of party staff will need to be pointed towards the exit, and the entire party structures would, in my opinion, need to undergo a comprehensive and thorough review. On the latter point, essentially we need the sweeping away of the current party form.” He added: “It would not be wrong to describe Jeremy as the Bennite continuity candidate, but with the advantage that the ideas Benn espoused and others worked for have finally seen their time come.”	Politics
568	569	Nestlé agrees to pay all employees living wage 	"Food giant Nestlé has become the first leading manufacturer to commit to paying the living wage. The firm already pays at least the living wage to its 8,000 staff but the move will benefit contract employees and agency workers. About 800 contractors working with Nestlé will implement it by December 2017. The announcement was described by campaigners as a significant milestone in the drive to persuade employers to pay the living wage, which is currently set at £8.80 an hour in London and £7.65 elsewhere, compared to the national minimum wage of £6.31. Nestlé UK & Ireland's chief executive, Fiona Kendrick, said: ""We are proud to be the first mainstream manufacturer in the UK to become a living wage employer and see this as an opportunity to be a positive influence in our sector. ""As a major UK employer, we know that this is the right thing to do. Not only does it benefit our employees but also the communities they live and work in."" Living Wage Foundation director Rhys Moore said: ""The accreditation of Nestlé as a living wage employer marks a significant milestone in the campaign to tackle in-work poverty. We hope that the leadership they have shown will encourage others in this industry to follow suit and improve conditions for those at the lowest end of the pay scale and sub-contracted staff. ""We are aware that Nestlé is going above and beyond the basic requirements of becoming an accredited employer, and is extending their commitment to graduate, internship and school leaver programmes."" Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: ""With in-work poverty on the rise, many employers are simply ignoring their responsibility to pay staff a decent wage. They should take note from Nestlé's positive stance which shows that paying a living wage is not just good for communities but makes good business sense too."" Tim Roache, of the GMB union, said: ""Nestlé have always recognised their greatest asset is their workforce and are demonstrating this with action, not just words. This shows once and for all that if one leading manufacturer can pay a living wage to all employees including young workers and those contracted out, then many more are able to do so."" The business secretary, Vince Cable, said: ""I welcome Nestlé's decision and encourage all businesses to pay their staff above the minimum wage when it is affordable and not at the expense of jobs."" The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: ""It is fantastic news that Nestlé is announcing its accreditation as a living wage employer, having worked in collaboration with Unite, GMB and the Living Wage Foundation to achieve this. ""We want to see as many businesses as possible take the decision to become living wage employers, so I hope other firms will follow the strong example which Nestlé is setting."""	Business

On Monday, the fast-food giant revealed that for a 12th straight month, same-restaurant sales around the world were down. The 0.3% drop, however, exceeded expectation. Analysts expected a decline of 0.9%. The figures were mainly achieved thanks to a 2.3% increase in sales in Europe.

6440	6441	David Cameron's Scotland visit presents problem for the no campaign 	" arrives in Scotland on Thursday in the peculiar position of being the old Etonian Tory leader who volunteered to help set up Scotland's independence referendum and the man hated by yes campaigners for being an old Etonian Tory. The leader of a party with just one MP in , Cameron is the bogeyman of the independence movement, instigator as prime minister of a severe austerity programme, greater NHS privatisation in England and of welfare reforms which led to the widely-hated bedroom tax and tax cuts for the wealthiest. He is, say Scottish National party officials, one of the best recruitment sergeants for a yes vote. His government in London is the focus of Yes Scotland's final phase of the referendum: that Scotland ""must"" vote yes, to save itself from the Tories. Those Westminster-driven reforms are influencing tens of thousands of Labour voters to consider backing independence, as a protest vote against a Tory-led government, helping Scotland's once disparate socialist and green left to unite in a new, highly motivated coalition, the Radical Independence Campaign. So Alex Salmond, the first minister, knew he was touching a raw wound when he goaded Labour's Alistair Darling, leader of the pro-UK Better Together coalition which has the Tories as a significant junior partner, in Monday's BBC independence debate with the charge ""You're in bed with the Tories."" It is an uncomfortable alliance for the former Labour chancellor; the SNP has put him the awkward position of having to defend UK government health spending and policies.So addressing the annual dinner for the Confederation of British Industry's Scotland branch in Glasgow on Thursday night serves to amplify that problem for the no campaign. But behind this is a more complex picture and one which presents Salmond and Yes Scotland with its own challenges: by focusing so much fire on Cameron and the Tories in a bid to attract centre-left votes, they risk creating divisions amongst Scottish voters. By implication, Scots who admire or back the prime minister and his party are enemies too. The Tories do have a profound image problem in Scotland, and their support remains fixed at less than 20%. Yet in the last European election, the Tory vote rose slightly to 17%, even as Ukip gained historic high with 10% of the vote, winning their first breakthrough European seat in Scotland. And the polls suggest too that Cameron is twice as popular as his party: Ipsos Mori found in August that while 15% of Scots would vote in Tory for the Scottish parliament – where the Tories have 15 seats, Cameron in person had a 30% satisfaction rating amongst voters. Cameron's advisers insist that Salmond and the yes camp's focus on the prime minister and the Tories has little impact, portraying it as ""dog whistle politics aimed at their core vote"". They argue that Cameron has played a largely very positive role in the referendum, after all, he agreed to make the referendum constitutional and fair, by granting the Scottish parliament the legal authority to stage it. ""He was the capitalist who made it happen,"" said one Downing Street official, who argues Cameron has helped frame a positive tone to the debate. ""He was the one to say you're no less in love with your country by wanting it to be part of something bigger"" the adviser said. ""His poll ratings aren't the horror story that they like to portray."" Yet that Ipsos Mori poll also exposed how greatly he is disliked: his dissatisfaction rating was at 66%. He had the highest recognition rating of all the main party leaders, a point higher than Salmond. And so the predicament for the no campaign is – with the yes campaign putting such heavy emphasis on Tory policies in the final weeks of the campaign, whether there is a clear risk his presence will drive more wavering centre left voters to say yes in the referendum, and put even greater pressure on Labour to stop that happening. After all, Tory voters are the most committed no voters. He has no need to convert them."	Politics

Brady, the Tories’ small business ambassador – who was appointed to the House of Lords last year – makes the appeal on a members’ section of the party’s website under the headline “Please sign our business letter”. The proposed letter says: “This Conservative-led government has been genuinely committed to making sure Britain is open for business … We would like to see David Cameron and George Osborne given the chance to finish what they have started. A change now would be far too risky and would undo all the good work of the last five years.” Brady’s letter shows Tories believed they achieved something of a coup when the last week endorsing the party. The signatories to the letter included 32 business leaders, who have donated more than £9m to the Conservatives. signed by more than 100 people “from all walks of life” endorsing Ed Miliband’s approach to the economy. The proposed letter by Brady, who made her name as the managing director of Birmingham City football club, comes after supporters of the health secretary emailed sympathetic doctors to ask them whether they would be prepared to back the plea on behalf of Hunt. The email says: “There is a letter being put together saying that the shouldn’t be used as a political football during the election campaign. If you are willing in principle to support this, please reply to Jeremy Hunt’s adviser.” The Tory fightback was revealed by health writer Roy Lilley. He : “Tories canvassing for a ‘support the NHS’ letter from doctors – the games continue!” A Labour source said: “The Tory campaign is in crisis. Yet again we are seeing unsubstantiated attacks on Labour which the Conservative party is coordinating backfiring, left, right and centre. “Only Labour will cut and freeze business rates, set up a small business administration and a proper British investment bank to back small firms and tackle the national scandal of late payment. Where the Tories have failed to act, the next Labour government will.”	Politics
8027	8028	Eurozone crisis: policymakers fear worst after losing control 	We have been here before. As battle-hardened veterans of the panic of 2008 were quick to point out, early November 2011 has started to look frighteningly like mid-September 2008. It is not just that a policy error – George Papandreou's decision to pursue a referendum – has triggered financial market mayhem, although it has. Nor is it just that there has been a deluge of bad news. It is the inescapable sense that policymakers have lost control of the situation and now fear for the worst. That's how it was three years ago when the US Treasury allowed Lehman Brothers to go bust. And that's how it has been this week following the announcement by Papandreou that he wanted to hold a referendum – hastily abandoned on Thursday – on the bailout package agreed for . At the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund six weeks ago, Britain's chancellor, George Osborne, set a six-week deadline for the eurozone to resolve its sovereign debt crisis. Those six weeks expire with the current two-day gathering of the G20 group of developed and developing nations in Cannes, and it is an understatement to say that the deadline has not been met. Greece is in turmoil, with Papandreou on his way out and elections likely. Silvio Berlusconi's days are also numbered, with his departure likely to take place against the worrying backdrop of an intensifying financial crisis in Italy. Bond yields on Italian debt climbed sharply on Thursday to their highest levels since the creation of the single currency. Just as the contagion from Lehmans quickly spread to other banks seen as weak – HBOS and RBS, in Britain's case – so the infection has spread from Greece to other vulnerable eurozone members. Nor does the parallel end there. Within a week of Lehmans going down, even banks that had appeared healthy were at risk. The current increase in French bond yields is a deeply troubling development. How will this end? Well, nobody in Cannes needed to be reminded that the six months after the Lehman bankruptcy saw the biggest collapse in global economic activity since the 1930s, with a seizing-up of banking, industrial production and trade. In Britain's case, national output fell by 7% and in the subsequent three years only half the lost ground has been regained. The fear is this: back in 2008, policymakers were well armed, united and fresh. Today they are none of those things. Interest rates have been cut to the bone, the money taps turned full on, the public finances trashed. Ammunition of the traditional kind is running out, leaving central bankers and finance ministries dependent on untried ways of boosting activity. That will be made more difficult because of lack of agreement in any relevant forum – the G8, the G20, the or the Euro Group – about what should be done. There has been a spectacular lack of leadership. Finally, it is clear that politcians, especially those in , are exhausted. Take a look at Nicolas Sarkozy. He looks spent. Policymakers have to galvanise themselves for one last effort because, if they don't, the risk is that the recession about to engulf them will be as bad as, if not worse than, that seen in 2008-09. Problem number one is that monetary union is a flawed concept and always has been. A one-size-fits-all interest rate didn't work and intensified the boom-bust cycles of the weaker eurozone states. Problem number two is that the debt crisis is far from over, and its continuation has compounded the pressure on the peripheral eurozone countries. The banking system remains dysfunctional and credit is both scarce and expensive. Britain and the United States have at least been able to relieve some of the pressure on their economies through a depreciating currency. Greece, Italy and Spain have not enjoyed that luxury. Problem number three is that there has been a series of blunders in the handling of Greece, which throughout has been a question of too much and too little: too much austerity and too little recognition that the problems of one small country could be as systemically important as one relatively small American investment bank. Sarkozy and Angela Merkel must now be ruing all those missed opportunities when they could have accepted the need for a clean Greek default rather than settling for muddling through. Almost certainly, it is now too late to avoid the eurozone sliding back into recession this winter, dragging the UK with it. Even now, though, it would be possible to prevent a full-blown slump. First, the European Central Bank needs to start buying Italian bonds aggressively and regularly. The odd €5bn of purchases will not be sufficient: the ECB needs to be thinking in terms of €500bn or €1tn. Given the magnitude of the crisis, Germany will, inevitably, object strongly, but Merkel has a stark choice. Germany can either sanction massive intervention by the ECB or it can accept that the single currency will shrink to perhaps a handful of countries, in which case the euro will go through the roof and kill Germany's export-led economy. Second, the G20 needs successfully to complete the negotiations in Cannes to increase the firepower of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is going to need cash, and plenty of it, if it is to help bail out Europe and be a more effective lender of last resort. Third, there has to be a recognition that the fetish for austerity in some countries is proving self-defeating. Those who warned that the global economy was not fit to withstand savage budget cuts so soon after coming off the life support machine have been proved right. The current low bond yields in Britain, Germany and the US are a sign not of strength but of distress, but they do afford the opportunity to borrow for long-term, productive capital programmes at very attractive rates. That opportunity should be seized, because policymakers need to re-engage with electorates unhappy about the lack of jobs, the squeeze on living standards, the widening gulf between the haves and have-nots, and the overriding feeling that big finance has got away with it. The mood is ugly, and unless policy-makers act with a sure-footedness and sensitivity not seen up to now, it is about to get uglier.	Business

14298	14299	Alleged Silk Road founder ordered to New York to face charges 	"A federal judge on Wednesday ordered a California man charged with operating a notorious online drug marketplace known as to be sent to New York to face charges. The order by US magistrate judge Joseph Spero came during a brief court hearing in for Ross Ulbricht. Federal authorities in New York have charged Ulbricht with three felonies related to the operation of the website. Ulbricht's attorney, public defender Brandon LeBlanc, has denied the charges. Silk Road gained widespread notoriety two years ago as a black market bazaar where visitors could buy and sell drugs using bitcoins, a form of online cash. A so-called hidden site, Silk Road used an online tool known as Tor to mask the location of its servers. Ulbricht agreed to remain in custody. Authorities have said Ulbricht operated the website under various aliases, including ""Dread Pirate Roberts"". His attorney denied he used any aliases. While many other sites sell drugs more or less openly, Silk Road's technical sophistication, its user-friendly system and its promise of near-total anonymity quickly made it among the best known. The FBI shut down the site when they arrested Ulbricht on October 1 at a small branch library in San Francisco as he chatted online with a ""co-operating witness,"" according to authorities and court papers. He is also charged in Baltimore federal court with soliciting the murder of a former worker who was arrested on drug charges. The indictment alleges Ulbricht feared the former worker would turn on him. The FBI said Ulbricht unwittingly hired an undercover agent for the murder, which the FBI staged but never took place. Prosecutors in have charged Ulbricht – a Texan who was living in San Francisco and holds degrees from the University of Texas and Penn State – with trying unsuccessfully to solicit the murder of a Canadian man who allegedly hacked into Silk Road, obtained dealers names and began blackmailing Ulbricht. FBI agents appear to have penetrated the behind-the-scenes operations of Silk Road and obtained a list of the site's users and sellers, court papers show. In the following days, authorities in Britain, Sweden and the United States arrested eight people who are charged with using the site to sell drugs. In Washington state, a man and a woman were arrested on charges of selling cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine through the now-shuttered website. In the UK, the country's newly established National Crime Agency . ""These latest arrests are just the start; there are many more to come,"" said Keith Bristow, head of the agency. In court papers, the FBI said it had managed to copy the – something one expert said would likely provide international authorities with detailed information about the site's dealers. Silk Road's eBay-style customer review system means that months' worth of sales history are now in law enforcement hands, according to a computer expert who studies bitcoins. ""Any large sellers on Silk Road should be very nervous,"" said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley and the University of California, San Diego. The traceable nature of bitcoin transfers means the FBI ""can now easily follow the money,"" Weaver said in an email."	Technology
1851	1852	Surprise inflation fall may put interest rate rise on hold 	The prospects of an interest rate rise in the next few months have dimmed after inflation fell to a five-year low last month. Official figures showed inflation dropped to 1.2% in September from 1.5% in August as food and fuel prices fell. The easing pace of price rises will take some pressure off households that have been struggling with below-inflation pay rises for years and will be welcomed by homeowners who had been bracing themselves for higher mortgage costs in the new year. The inflation figure also means the basic state pension will rise by 2.5%, or £2.85 a week, in April, as the government’s “triple lock” guarantees a rise of whichever is the greater out of average earnings, September’s inflation rate or 2.5%. Financial markets were caught off guard by the fall as City economists had expected a more modest slowdown in consumer price inflation (CPI) to 1.4%. The pound weakened against the euro and the dollar, and yields fell on UK government bonds as traders pushed back bets on when the central bank will start to raise rates from their current record low. The markets are now pricing in the first rise in borrowing costs for mid-2015. Until now the market consensus had been the early months of next year, though some economists had warned growth was softening and price pressures were benign. “We have long been expecting the Bank of England to first raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% in February – but it is looking ever more likely that the Bank will delay acting until nearer mid-year,” said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. “Much will clearly depend on just how well UK growth holds up over the coming weeks and months, as well as how much wages move up in the 2015 pay settlements,” he said. The . Food and fuel prices also fell on the year after a supermarket price war and a sharp fall in crude oil prices. Excluding volatile items such as food and fuel, there was still a let-up in price pressures and core inflation stood at 1.5%, down from 1.9% in August. The retail price index measure of inflation, which includes housing costs and is used to set many pay deals, fell to 2.3% from 2.4% in August. The Bank has a government-set consumer prices index (CPI) target of 2.0%. If inflation misses that by more than one percentage point on either side, the governor, Mark Carney, must write an open letter to the chancellor, George Osborne, explaining the reasons and what the Bank proposes to do about it. Samuel Tombs of the Capital thinktank thinks there is a good chance Carney will have to put pen to paper given inflation looks likely to fall further over coming months owing to falling oil prices and pledges from utility companies to freeze prices this winter. Tombs also pointed to separate official figures that showed prices paid and charged by manufacturers continued to fall in September. “The absence of any major underlying inflationary pressure should still ensure that interest rates rise at a very gradual pace by past standards,” he said. The Treasury welcomed the fall in inflation as “further evidence that the government’s long-term economic plan is working”, and also highlighted the 2.5% rise in the state pension. “That means around an extra £150 more in the pockets next year of those that have worked hard all their lives,” said a Treasury spokesman. But some economists noted that the proposed rise in pension payments will leave a disparity between benefits paid to young and old. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said: “September’s inflation rate usually has important ramifications for public finances, as it is used to uprate benefit payments. However, with government policy limiting growth in most working age benefits to 1% next year, the net gain to the exchequer from a lower inflation reading will be limited. “Pensioners are set to enjoy a relative windfall. With inflation and earnings growth so low, the ‘triple lock’ means that pensions are set to rise much faster than pay or benefits received by younger people.” Labour pointed out that inflation is still higher than average pay growth, meaning wages continue to fall in real terms. Catherine McKinnell, the shadow Treasury minister, said real wages had fallen by £1,600 a year since 2010. “The squeeze on working people continues despite this fall in the rate of inflation. Total pay is rising at just 0.6%, which is half the rate of CPI inflation announced today,” she said.	Business
7986	7987	Ed Miliband warned to stop talking about north-south divide 	" and other Labour frontbenchers have been told to stop making the ""classic mistake"" of talking about a north-south divide if they want to avoid alienating voters in southern England who abandoned the party at the last election. frontbenchers have been told to bear in mind the commuter on the ""6.54 from Basingstoke"" if they are to win back trust among voters in southern England outside London. The appeal has been made by , the former cabinet minister and MP for Southampton Itchen, who has carried out a review to examine how Labour can improve its performance in the south. Denham is one of just 10 Labour MPs elected in 2010 in southern seats outside London, the same number as in 1992, when Labour also lost. Tony Blair won about 40 seats in the south in 1997. Denham used a to define the north-south divide. This creates a line from just south of Grimsby to the northern side of the Severn Estuary before it joins Wales. Denham : ""It used to be quite common to hear people talk about the north-south divide. If you think about that, the message is that everybody in the southern part is doing OK. If you use that language, it sounds as though you represent the northern bit. A classic mistake for the party for a long time was using that sort of language – and then wondering why people in the south didn't think we were talking about them."" Denham's report is designed to help Miliband, who was London born and raised and was elected as MP for Doncaster North in 2005, as he seeks to develop his message of creating a so-called one-nation Labour party. After the 2010 election the former local government secretary , which was first published after Labour's 1992 defeat. Denham told the Times the Labour party should try to use examples of pressures of life in the south. ""If someone in the Labour party talks about rail fares, a southern voter may not automatically think they were talking about them, on the 6.54 from Basingstoke. You have to make the point that you are talking about the 6.54 from Basingstoke. ""There are towns around London where the average wage may be above the national average, but because the costs of housing and transport are so high, the living standards are below the national average. Part of what we are doing is making sure we are clearly rooting what we say with the lives of people in the south."" The 6.54 is a genuine commuter train from Basingstoke, the constituency of the culture secretary, Maria Miller, which is close to Denham's seat. It arrives at London Waterloo at 7.59am. Denham says Labour should reach out to former supporters by saying it understands why they supported the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives in 2010. He told the Times: ""It will be a very sympathetic approach that says: 'Look, we can understand why in 2010 you put your trust in the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, but actually you have been failed by them.' We will leave people [in the south] in no doubt that it is them we are appealing to, and that we want them to trust us as a party of government."""	Politics

3216	3217	UK business minister to tackle steel dumping in China trip 	The government looks set to clash with Chinese ministers next week after promising to raise the sensitive issue of steel “dumping” following a new threat to 3,000 jobs in the north east of England. George Osborne leads a delegation to Beijing which includes the business minister, Anna Soubry, who said on Friday that she would raise the issues that are threatening the survival of the Redcar steel works. “We help with energy costs and recently voted to protect our steel industry from Chinese dumping. Next week I am in China and I will talk to Chinese officials,” said Soubry. She was speaking after SSI, the owner of the plant on Teesside said it was going to halt production and mothball some operations amid mounting financial losses. The company blamed a deteriorating steel market for the suspension of output at the 160-year-old site. It said it hoped to resume production eventually. The Thai-owned SSI is struggling to pay outstanding debts, leading to speculation about how long it could keep going while employing 2,000 staff and 1,000 contractors. Any closure would be a heavy blow because levels of unemployment are among the highest in Britain. “We are taking this pause in production in order to re-evaluate and assess the situation following the outcome of ongoing discussions with our various stakeholders, including government and suppliers,” said Cornelius Louwrens, SSI’s UK business director. “It is with great regret that we have had to make this announcement and we are deeply aware of the concern it will give to our employees and their families.” SSI bought Redcar from Tata Steel, which had mothballed the plant. Last month, Tata announced plans to . In July, the India-based group said it might need to , amid high UK energy prices and mounting competition, particularly from low cost products made in China. SSI said the price for “slab” steel – usually further processed to use in pipes and tubes – had plummeted from $500 a tonne to below $300 over the past year. “The problems within the global steel industry have been well publicised in recent weeks and our decision follows a major deterioration in steel prices affecting our business during the course of this year,” it said. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, the steelworkers’ union, said: “Our first thoughts are with the workers who will be affected by today’s announcement. We will be seeking urgent talks with SSI management to find out the full extent of the impact this will have on both SSI employees and contractors.” And the industry lobby, UK Steel, said this business sector was facing a major threat and urgent action was needed by ministers. “It (the SSI decision) comes just 24 hours after the government agreed to hold a crisis summit about the UK steel industry and this cannot happen soon enough,” said Gareth Stace, Director UK Steel. “I trust ministers will put in place the machinery to get on with this as a priority and that they will bring tangible offers of support. The time for warm words has passed. ... If they don’t act decisively, then the damage to one of the most important industries underpinning our entire manufacturing sector will be irreversible.”	Business

Due to its decentralised nature – the currency does not rely on any centralised agency to process payments, instead relying on work done by users’ computers – it is popular for a number of fringe-legal and illegal uses. One of those uses was Silk Road, where was required for all transactions.

At current exchange rates, that represents slightly more than 5% of all bitcoins in circulation. Even if the FBI is not able to transfer the money, now that Ulbricht is in captivity and most of his possessions have been seized, the funds are likely to stay where they are. A few high-security ways of storing bitcoins, such as a ""brainwallet"", a way of converting a bitcoin address into an easy-to-remember phrase, could still bypass their authority, but there is no indication at present that Ulbricht has used them. This article has been amended to clarify why Ulbricht's funds have apparently remained untouched."	Technology

The £38m fine is the second punishment Barclays has received for breaches of client asset rules. It is bigger than , when City regulators began focusing on client asset rules in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The unwinding of Lehman has proved more complex because its own assets were mixed up with those clients, making it more difficult to pay them back. Almost a dozen fines have been handed out for this breach of the rules, which in Barclays’ case is thought to cover the period between 2007 and 2012. While this time frame predates the appointment of Antony Jenkins as chief executive, the latest punishment comes as he attempts to defend the bank against fraud charges in the US and after . There had been reports that the latest fine for Barclays could be as high as £60m, which would have been on top of the for failing to keep clients’ money separate from its own.

6807	6808	Fred Goodwin could lose knighthood, says David Cameron 	"The knighthood awarded to Sir Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of the , will be referred to the honours forfeiture committee, David Cameron has said. The prime minister said the committee, which has powers to strip recipients of their honours, would take into account a by the Financial Services Authority. Goodwin was at the helm of RBS when it was in effect nationalised in 2008 after making a £24.1bn loss. Responding to questions about Goodwin's knighthood, Cameron said: ""I think it is right that there is a proper process that is followed for something of this order. There is a forfeiture committee in terms of honours that exists and it will now examine this issue. I think it is right that it does so. ""Obviously it will want to take account of the Financial Services Authority report which I think is material and important because of what it says about the failures of RBS and what went wrong and who is responsible and the rest of it."" He said the committee rather than the prime minister should make the decision. In a keynote speech, in which he called for a new form of popular capitalism, Cameron said he expected the cash element of bonuses at the state-owned banks RBS and Lloyds to be restricted to £2,000 for a second year. He said the remuneration committee of RBS had yet to meet to decide whether to give the RBS boss, Sir Stephen Hester, a large bonus, adding that non-executive directors approved by the government would argue his bonus should be smaller than last year. ""There has been no meeting of the remuneration committee of RBS so no decision has been made,"" he replied to questions about bonuses at the bank. Referring to Hester, he said: ""If there is a bonus, it will be a lot less than last year."" ""As a major shareholder in the City we will be repeating what we did last year and restricting bonuses in all state owned banks to £2,000."" He said bank managers, tellers and junior staff were doing their best so there should be a small cash bonus. In his speech, Cameron put emphasis on wider shareholding, stronger markets and less regulation and said strong markets promoted morality. ""We should use this crisis of capitalism to improve markets, not undermine them,"" he said. In a speech in London billed as his attempt to position the Conservatives as the party ideologically and historically equipped to create a responsible capitalism, the prime minister admitted the link between risk, reward and effort had been broken. He insisted: ""We won't build a better economy by turning our back on the free market. We'll do it by making sure that the market is fair as well as free."" Markets can be made to work ""by empowering shareholders and using the power of transparency"", he said. He also insisted the answer did not lie in more regulation but less, so long as it was better. He argued: ""While of course there is a role for government, for regulation and intervention, the real solution is more enterprise, competition and innovation. ""Where they work properly, open markets and free enterprise can actually promote morality. ""The fundamental basis of the market is the idea of something for something – an idea we need to encourage, not condemn,"" he said. The speech contained little by way of new policy, except to promise to combine 17 different pieces of co-operative legislation into a single bill. He argued the Conservatives were well placed to reform markets because ""we get the free market. We know its failings as well as its strengths. No true Conservative has a naive belief that all politics has to do is step back and let capitalism rip."" Admitting markets can fail, he said: ""Uncontrolled globalisation can slide into monopolisation, sweeping aside the small, the personal and the local."" Drawing on the control of the East India Company, the repeal of the corn laws, the Factory Act and William Pitt's reforms of government, he argued that Tory governments had repeatedly controlled capitalism. He pointed out he had, at the start of his leadership, argued that the previous government's turbo-capitalism turned a blind eye to corporate excess. Labour, by contrast, had made a Faustian pact with the City encouraging a debt-crazed economy to fund its welfare bill, he said. He claimed Labour feared standing up to the City and mistook the interests of big business for those of the economy. ""The City, which should have been a powerhouse of competition and creativity, became instead a byword for a sort of financial wizardry that left the taxpayer with all the risk, and a fortunate few with all of the rewards. ""So instead of popular capitalism we ended up with unpopular capitalism."" He praised genuine reward, saying: ""When people take risks, with their own ideas, energy and money, when they succeed in a competitive market where anyone can come and knock them off their perch at any time, we should celebrate entrepreneurs who get rich in that way."" But he warned: ""Large rewards for failure when companies are suffering means even less is left over for customers and shareholders."" Without giving details, he said the business secretary, Vince Cable, would set out proposals next week, and he also promised to implement the Vickers report on banking designed to separate retail and investment banking. He also promised to ""bust open the cosy collusion between big business and big government that locks small businesses out of public sector contracts – a market worth £150bn a year"". He argued that capitalism would never be free unless there were genuine opportunities for everyone to participate and benefit. He said the answer to better equality of opportunity lay in better education ""with academies, free schools, rigour in exams and a complete intolerance of failure"". ""In an age when we're having to cut public spending, we are investing more in early years childcare,"" he said. He said the task was to create an insurgent economy, arguing Britain was fizzing with business potential and what he admired more than anything was ""the bravery of those who turn their back on the security of a regular wage to follow their dreams and start a company"". He ended by arguing for the need to build a fairer economy, saying Britain needed more shareholders, more home-owners, more co-operatives and more entrepreneurs. There are too many barriers in the way of forming co-operatives, he said: ""Right now there are too many barriers in the way, 17 separate and outdated pieces of legislation add cost and complexity."""

10375	10376	Adnan Januzaj wins place in preliminary Belgium World Cup squad 	" midfielder Adnan Januzaj will be included in Belgium's preliminary World Cup squad, head coach Marc Wilmots has confirmed. Last week Wilmots revealed Januzaj had pledged his international allegiance to despite interest from England, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey and Serbia. Januzaj will have a chance to impress Wilmots at a pre-World Cup training camp next month, although the Belgium coach has warned the teenager he is not guaranteed to make his final 23. ""I have seen him play several times and now I want to see him with the squad,"" Wilmots told Le Soir. ""I will include him in the list of 30 pre-selected players for the and he will be one of the 26 or 27 players who take part in training in Genk and then in Sweden. ""I prefer to keep the numbers down but Januzaj will be there."" Januzaj joined United from Anderlecht in 2011 and was promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a series of impressive performances in the youth sides. The 19-year-old made his debut in United's Community Shield win over Wigan last August and he has since gone on to make 32 appearances and score four goals. Wilmots has not promised the flexible teenager he will be going to the World Cup, although the Belgium coach conceded his chances had improved following the news that Aston Villa forward Christian Benteke will miss the tournament in Brazil because of a torn Achilles tendon. ""Things were clear between us: he has received no assurance from me of a place in the World Cup squad,"" Wilmots added. ""I only said he was selectable. Adnan and his entourage were very receptive and understood the message perfectly. The truth will come out on the pitch and he will have to win his place like everyone else. ""What is for sure is that the boy is an interesting player in the absence of Christian Benteke. Not many people know but in the Manchester United reserve team, he has often played as a number nine. His versatility is an asset."" The Football Association was keen to get Januzaj to commit to England, even though the player would have had to wait until 2018 to pull on the Three Lions due to residency rules. But Januzaj, who has Kosovar-Albanian parents, instead chose to represent the country of his birth following a meeting with Wilmots. ""With Adnan and his father, we spoke for a bit more than three hours,"" the Belgium coach revealed. ""I explained to them both that I know well the sensitivity for a family in Belgium who retain links to their country of origin. I told them whatever Adnan decided would be respected. ""Adnan was born in Brussels, went to school here and his education as a young footballer came at Brussels and Anderlecht before he headed overseas."""	Football
11541	11542	Chelsea 2-2 Swansea City 	José Mourinho was right. This is the real deal, what people want, what they can’t wait to devour. This was that edge-of-the-seat, don’t-dare-blink, full-pelt competitive heat of football that counts. Every point counts. And here, in quite intense fashion, dropped two on game one of their title defence. An engrossing match twisted and turned, with both Chelsea and Swansea taking turns to swing their swords, charge on the offensive and retreat to catch their breath. In a topsy-turvy encounter the home team led twice and the visitors bounced back to equalise. It was all played out with a generous twist of drama. The most extraordinary moment denied Chelsea a winning start when Thibaut Courtois was sent off in a reckless attempt to stop Bafétimbi Gomis from advancing past him. Swansea’s powerhouse attacker maintained his composure to tuck away the penalty and earn Garry Monk’s team a proud result. Mourinho had suggested his team would have to offer more to defend the title than , and here was proof of the complexity of the challenge. There was a lot to digest. While Mourinho was at great pains to avoid getting tangled up in another conspiracy fandango so early in the season, in the wider analysis Chelsea sent out mixed messages here. At times they were dazzling, displaying the synchronicity and zest that a confident team of winners can ooze. At others they were frayed, as Swansea strutted their own stuff and exhibited a mix of power and panache to unsettle the best of defences. They also bristled with the desire to win even with 10 men. There was so much to take in packed into the 90 minutes. The opening notes seemed to blend seamlessly from last season’s songbook. Within seconds Eden Hazard – the current – was gliding at speed through the Swansea half. Diego Costa, fit enough to reclaim the position he occupies in inimitable fashion, hassled a defender and nudged at the opposition goalkeeper just because he can’t resist it. Oscar crafted the lead midway through the first half. When César Azpilicueta won a free-kick just a fraction outside the corner of the penalty area, the Brazilian delivered with whip and fizz. Both Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic tried to get a nick on the ball, but neither were needed as the ball curled past Lukasz Fabianski. Swansea, determined to avoid being overwhelmed as they were against Chelsea last season, recovered with character and wit. The sparkling Jefferson Montero stood up a wonderful cross for Gomis, who powered in a header that Courtois reacted to superbly to beat out. André Ayew picked up the rebound and steered in the equaliser, showing neat footwork to carve out space for the shot at the second attempt. The new boy from Marseille was overjoyed. It was riveting stuff, and back came Chelsea to retrieve the lead within a minute as Willian’s effort spun off Federico Fernández’s foot and looped over the helpless Fabianski. The game was finely poised. Yet despite moments of excellence from Chelsea, Swansea sensed there were goals to be plundered themselves. And when another one came, it was fuelled by high drama. Chelsea were stunned when Jonjo Shelvey’s delightful chipped pass sent Gomis marauding goalwards. He was met by Courtois, whose attempted tackle caught the Frenchman at thigh level on the edge of the penalty area. The result was a penalty for Swansea and a red card for Courtois. The delay as Asmir Begovic prepared himself to come on and face the spot kick had no ill effect on Gomis. He was coolness personified as he slotted in for 2-2. Monk felt it was entirely merited. “The message to the team is we can take anyone on,” he said. “I wanted the team to showcase what we can do on the front foot and to come to a place like this, after the goals we conceded last season, we wanted to put that right. It’s just one game, one point, but to come and do it here where we suffered last season should give us confidence.” Mourinho chose not to talk about the red card other than to suggest it “changed everything”. Despite that, both teams had a whiff of winning the game. Montero was on a mission to unpick Chelsea at will. Defenders of Ivanovic’s ilk don’t often experience the kind of chasing he endured trying to keep pace with the Ecuadorian’s wizardry. Even with reduced numbers, Chelsea were able to press and probe, but with wariness of what might befall them at the other end. Could they somehow seize victory from the jaws of difficulty and disappointment? Hazard, who after a bright start had been peripheral by his standards, roused himself to dart into the box and drive an angled shot which hit Fabianski. Hazard began to bewitch Swansea, dominating the momentum almost single-handedly. On came Radamel Falcao to see if he could make the difference. When the stakes overheated, Ashley Williams took a yellow card for hoiking down the increasingly determined Hazard mid-dribble in stoppage time. At the end of it all, both teams looked wrung out and exhausted. The fun and games have only just begun.	Football
7982	7983	Lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailouts 	s the Greek crisis evolves, it is important to understand that a successful structural adjustment programme requires strong country ownership. Even if negotiators overcome the most recent sticking points, it will be difficult to trust in their implementation if the Greek people remain unconvinced. That has certainly been the experience so far. And without structural reform, there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece than it is asked to pay. (This has been the case through most of the crisis, even if one would never know it from the world press coverage.) Greece’s membership in the gives its creditors significant leverage, but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus. Greece remains very much a sovereign country, not a sub-sovereign state. The troika of creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European commission – simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over Greece that, say, the Municipal Assistance Corporation wielded over New York City when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid-1970s. The best structural adjustment programmes are those in which the debtor country’s government proposes the policy changes, and the IMF helps design a bespoke programme and provides the political cover for its implementation. Imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option. So, for reforms to take hold, the Greek government and its electorate must believe in them. That a country must take ownership of its reform programme is not a new lesson. The IMF’s with Ukraine began long before the latest round of negotiations. Back in 2013, IMF staff wrote a on the organisation’s experience in the country. Their conclusion, in essence, was that the government’s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed its programme would not work. If a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments, the report argued, the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented, as is now being done in . Unfortunately, that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there. Structural reform conditions often tilt the balance between competing domestic factions, for better or for worse. If there is no will inside the country to maintain the reforms, they will quickly be undermined. Leftwing ideologues have long viewed structural-reform programmes with deep suspicion, accusing international lenders such as the IMF and the World Bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists. This critique has some truth in it, but it is overblown. To be sure, structural reforms often favour policies such as labour-market flexibility. But one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black-and-white terms. Breaking down dual labour markets that are excluding young workers (as they do in much of southern , including Italy and, to some extent, France) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers. Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier. Making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes. Recently, opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections – most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero. If structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices, it may indeed be difficult in the short-term to counter the drop in aggregate demand. But a similar critique could be made of any other change in policy: if it is poorly designed, it will be counter-productive. The truth is that the way forward in Europe requires achieving greater productivity. The lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailout programmes are sobering. If a debt bailout programme requires a wholesale change in a country’s economic, social, and political model, the best course of action might be to write off the private losses, rather than pour in public money to cover them. In cases like Greece, the creditors’ passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home – particularly toward . . In an ideal world, offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state. But given the difficulty Greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal, it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely. In place of a programme providing the country with further loans, it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid – regardless of whether Greece remains fully within the eurozone.

5459	5460	Is Elderwood the digital arms dealer that fuelled attacks on Google? 	"Researchers have of a group believed to be selling highly valuable attack code to prolific cyber espionage hackers, including the team that was linked to a . Whilst Symantec researchers admitted they could not be certain a computer exploit owned by the digital arms dealer, known as Elderwood, was used against , it has been operating since at least 2009, when the tech titan was hit. The Elderwood supplier has frequently been linked to the 2009 attacks, which Google blamed on China. One customer, known as Hidden Lynx, was also associated with the campaign against Google, which targeted a range of US organisations. Hidden Lynx was identified as the group that breached security company Bit9 in 2012 too. Elderwood exploits have been used against a large number of industries, including defence, technology and human rights organisations, throughout 2014 and before. It was previously believed only one hacker group used the attack code, known as ""zero-day"" exploits because they use unpatched vulnerabilities in computer software. But it has become apparent more than one threat actor is involved, pointing to Elderwood as a zero-day supplier, possibly a professional outfit selling to government entities. The dealer has been linked with various zero-day vulnerabilities this year, including ones found in Internet Explorer and Adobe software. Various links between the different teams and the Elderwood supplier have been uncovered. They include code being hosted on the same web server and common hacking tools across groups. This has led Symantec to two likely scenarios. Either Elderwood is a parent organisation for many different but linked groups who are being handed the attack tools directly, or it is single arms dealer supplying any buyers who have their own separate agendas. There have been no signs of any technical links between Elderwood customers, such as shared command and control tools for their maware, said Gavin O'Gorman, senior security response analyst at Symantec. That there is one central supplier providing such attack code is rare to see, O’Gorman added. “We haven't seen that kind of common exploit development before,” he said, comparing Elderwood to a professional software company. Despite leaving its footprint on the internet, O’Gorman is doubtful the Elderwood group will ever be stopped. “It's not one central thing you can shut down. Although there are kind of little bits and pieces [that we can tie together], they change things up enough so that it makes it difficult for us to detect them. “For these kinds of attacks, I'd be surprised if you could arrest them... they've been around since at least 2009 and they haven't slipped up and revealed identities. There's not a lot you can do.”"	Technology
13993	13994	Fifa corruption arrests: Uefa calls for postponement of presidential election 	 has called for Fifa’s presidential election on Friday to be postponed as the shockwaves from the biggest scandal to hit the world governing body reverberated through the sport. Fifa was plunged into the most serious scandal in its history on Wednesday . Seven officials, including the Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb from the Cayman Islands, were arrested by Swiss authorities on behalf of the US Department of Justice, which has indicted 18 people alleging bribery totalling more than $150m (£98m). In a separate development, the Swiss attorney general also opened criminal proceedings over the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, seized documents and electronic data from Fifa’s headquarters and will question 10 current executive committee members who voted on that tournament. The twin proceedings have cast Fifa into a state of crisis and Uefa wants Friday’s presidential election between incumbent and Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan to be postponed. Uefa general secretary Gianni Infantino, speaking in Warsaw before the Europa League final, said in a statement: “Uefa believes that the Fifa congress should be postponed and that the election for the president should take place within six months.” The full Uefa statement following an executive committee meeting said: “Today’s events are a disaster for Fifa and tarnish the image of football as a whole. Uefa is deeply shocked and saddened by them. These events show, once again, that corruption is deeply rooted in Fifa’s culture. There is a need for the whole of Fifa to be ‘rebooted’ and for a real reform to be carried out. “The upcoming Fifa congress risks to turn into a farce and therefore the European associations will have to consider carefully if they should even attend this congress and caution a system, which, if it is not stopped, will ultimately kill football. The Uefa member associations are meeting tomorrow ahead of the Fifa congress. At that point, the European associations will decide on what further steps need to be taken to protect the game of football. “In the meantime, the members of the Uefa executive committee are convinced that there is a strong need for a change to the leadership of this Fifa and strongly believe that the Fifa congress should be postponed, with new Fifa presidential elections to be organised within the next six months.”	Football
13083	13084	James Gandolfini, remembered by Mike Figgis 	" was larger than life. I directed an episode of and got to know him a little. This was season five and it was clear that the cast and crew had been in the trenches with the show for a very long time. The characters were so strong that I had some difficulty separating the real names from the fictional. My first meeting with everyone was a table reading of the episode I was to direct, three days before we were on set. it was the lunch break and everyone was frazzled. I was the only outsider in the room. James sat next to me but we had no conversation. I contributed nothing to the read and then everyone left to continue shooting. Monday morning arrived and at 7am I found myself on the set. Lighting was quick, it was an ongoing set and suddenly the 1st assistant director got everyone's attention and it was over to me. I was extremely nervous. I sounded pretentiously English among all those New York accents, I knew a little but no-one else. I suggested a way of shooting the scene which involved James turning his back on his gang, giving a nice camera angle and also indicating that Tony Soprano was playing a double game. I had done my homework and thought it all out, or so I thought. James looked at me for the first time, a look of puzzlement combined with a ""Who is this guy"" expression. ""Why the fuck would Tony Soprano turn his back on his guys?"" It went quiet. Now I had everyone's attention. I wanted to die. The part of the brain that remains coherent whispered to me, don't argue with him. ""OK,"" I said. ""How would you do it?"" This sounded so weak, first bit of directing an admission of incompetence. I sat down and gave the floor to James and his merry men. Now, there were circumstances. Mr Gandolfini liked to party at weekends and he was nursing the mother of all hangovers. But from my perspective all I could see was my own failure with two weeks of humiliation stretching ahead of me. Perhaps I would be fired. On the floor, Tony Soprano and the boys tried the scene out ... and it was not working. James got more and more bad tempered and it seemed to me that everyone got more and more tense. Things ground to a halt. I had no idea what to do nor did I have any authority on the set, a new experience for me. ""OK, OK,"" said Gandolfini, ""let me try something."" And so the scene began again and this time he did exactly what I had suggested in the first place, but it was like he'd thought of it. I wanted to sob, I wanted my mother. And then James turned, looked at me in a very mean kind of way and then a huge grin spread across his face, he stuck out his hand and said, ""Fucking honour to have you on the show, big fan, welcome."" I'd been royally wound up by the big Gand'. Later, Buscemi told me he sometimes did that, liked to test directors out a bit. Thank God I didn't cry. After that we got on fine and at the end of the shoot he threatened to take me drinking but I chickened-out of that offer. I feel honoured that I got to direct him in such an iconic series. He was a really good actor and a very warm-hearted human being and way too young to exit."	Film
11524	11525	Aston Villa 2-0 West Bromwich Albion 	It has been quite a week for Aston Villa and Tim Sherwood, and one that promises to transform the complexion of their season. Fabian Delph’s first goal for 12 months, followed by a second from Scott Sinclair five minutes from time, condemned to a second defeat in the space of five days at the hands of their neighbours and secured Sherwood’s side a place in the FA Cup semi-final. That should have been the story of this fiercely contested local derby but the ugly scenes in the closing stages meant that the result was totally overshadowed by the sort of behaviour that everyone hoped belonged to another era. Albion supporters in the upper tier of the North Stand tore out seats and used them as a missiles while at the other end of the ground Villa supporters invaded the pitch during and after the game. Tony Pulis, the West Brom manager, described the pitch invasions as disgraceful and there was no sense that he was exaggerating the seriousness of the situation when he claimed that the players’ safety was put in danger. It was a free-for-all at the final whistle as hundreds of Villa fans spilled on to the pitch, leaving even their own captain feeling distressed. “Very, very scary,” said Delph, who claimed that he lost his armband, a boot and was bitten. Questions will be asked of the stewarding, the police and both clubs over the coming days, as well as the decision to stage a local derby with so much at stake at 5.30pm on a Saturday night. It is safe to say that the Football Association’s “crowd control adviser” – there was one present – is in for a busy weekend writing up everything he witnessed. A range of sanctions are available to the FA, although the likelihood is that both clubs will be fined, with Villa’s punishment expected to be more severe. There was also some controversy of a different kind in the shape of the two red cards that Anthony Taylor, the referee, showed in the second half. West Brom’s Claudio Yacob seemed particularly unlucky to be given a second yellow card for a foul on Leandro Bacuna in the 80th minute. Jack Grealish, a second-half substitute for Villa, was later given a second yellow card for diving. Pulis was bemused by both decisions. “It’s really, really disappointing. We’ve come here twice in five days.[Alan] Hutton should have been sent off in the week, doesn’t get sent off and he gets the cross in that [Ben] Foster spills and costs us a goal late on. “Today, really and truthfully, Yacob’s not a sending off. It’s two poor decisions. I don’t know what Grealish got sent off for. I was absolutely amazed when he showed a red card.” By the time Villa were reduced to 10 men the game was effectively over, with Grealish having set up their second goal moments earlier. Sinclair, arguably Villa’s most dangerous player in a much-improved second-half performance, took it superbly, checking inside Chris Brunt before curling a low right-foot shot from just inside the penalty area into the far corner. There was no way back for West Brom, who were left to rue their profligacy in the first half, in particular the two chances that fell to Brown Ideye, the first after only eight minutes when the Nigerian looked certain to score when he ran on to Craig Gardner’s fine first-time cross. Instead Ideye contrived to lift a left-foot shot over the crossbar. He should also have done better with an opportunity later in the half when he shouldered, rather than headed, Craig Dawson’s inviting centre from the right, leaving Shay Given with an easy save. Missing the injured Christian Benteke, Villa looked flat in the first half and created precious little but they carved a breakthrough shortly after the restart. Charles N’Zogbia, who seems to be flickering into life under Sherwood, picked up possession wide on the right and cut infield. With Dawson sucked to the ball and playing more like a centre-half than a right-back, space opened up for Delph in the inside-left channel. N’Zogbia released the ball at just the right time and the England international did the rest, drilling a low left-footed shot beyond Boaz Myhill, who was picked ahead of Ben Foster, and inside the near post. Albion could – and should – have been level six minutes later but Joleon Lescott was guilty of a poor miss that had Pulis spinning on his heel in frustration. Gardner’s corner kick from the left was inadvertently flicked on at the near post by Tom Cleverley and Lescott, arriving at the back post, looked destined to score. Inexplicably he headed wide. Chances came and went at both ends as the game became stretched. Given had to be quick off his line to smother at Saido Berahino’s feet while Sinclair went close for Villa twice in the space of two minutes. The winger was not so generous, however, when presented with a third opportunity. It is just a shame that few people were talking about his final goal afterwards.	Football
11091	11092	Greek government takes desperate measures in battle to stay afloat 	The Greek government is resorting to increasingly desperate measures to keep afloat amid dire warnings the debt-stricken country could go bust within weeks. In a balancing act not seen by any European administration in recent times, the cash-strapped coalition has sequestered the reserves of public bodies, seized EU subsidies destined for farmers and postponed all payments for state supplies in the scramble to continue servicing its debt and paying salaries and pensions. Pension funds have been raided to raise money for Treasury bill auctions. “It is clear we are reaching the end and very soon won’t be able to pay,” former finance minister, Stefanos Manos, told the Guardian. “They are scraping the bottom of the barrel for everything they can find.” To cover the credit crunch, corporations in which the state has a majority stake, including the Athens Metro, have been tapped. The scheme of repo transactions – where government bonds are used for short-term borrowing requirements – is believed to have raised upwards of €600m (£442m) in recent weeks. Earlier this month the leftist-led coalition suspended some €300m of EU subsidies for farmers to help pay €1.7bn in public sector wages and pensions due next week. Greek subsidiaries of multinationals have also been approached for loans. The last-resort measures came as Deutsche Bank warned that Athens was at risk of being pushed into default on 9 April when it must meet a €450m debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund. The precarious state of Athens’ finances has been exacerbated by a precipitous decline in tax revenues – more than €1bn below target since January – said the bank’s economists. Deposit flight has also ratcheted up the pressure. More than €20bn has fled the country since the beginning of the year as savers rush to withdraw funds, worried about Greece’s ability to remain in the euro. “The risk of capital controls continues to rise,” noted the Deutsche report. In what was interpreted as a sign of growing concern over the outflows, the – among the bodies that have bailed out the Greek economy to the tune of €240bn – agreed on Wednesday to raise emergency liquidity for local banks by €1bn to €71bn. As the government marked national Independence Day with celebrations that included a fly-past of fighter jets and tanks rumbling through the capital, hopes of easing the credit squeeze with a €1.2bn injection of cash from the EU were quashed. Athens’ argument that it had mistakenly returned the money to the EU’s rescue fund, from the country’s bank recapitalization fund, was rejected by Brussels. This week the ECB raised the pressure further by formally restricting Greek banks from buying government debt. The move makes agreement over reforms with international creditors ever more urgent and prime minister has been given until Monday to draft measures that will convince peers he is determined to overhaul the economy. Lenders have promised to unlock a €7.2bn aid disbursement if progress is made. In the two months since the anti-austerity government assumed power, relations with creditors – and especially Europe’s paymaster Germany – have worsened dramatically amid the administration’s brinkmanship over reforms. Talks between Tsipras and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on Monday helped soothe tensions, but the young Greek premier was told in no uncertain terms that his country’s fate now lies in his administration’s ability to devise persuasive structural changes. “They urgently need to present a coherent list of reforms and I am worried because they constantly seem to be backtracking,” said Manos, finance minister under a former conservative government. “Such a plan will definitely entail taking decisions that will displease some voters. The government has ruled out taking recessionary measures but such reforms will naturally be grossly recessionary. Tsipras simply has to explain the reality to Greeks.” Athens has come under fire for its treatment of technical teams dispatched by the EU and IMF to examine the government’s books. With money running out fast officials said it was expedient that now, more than ever, auditors were given free rein. The teams have been forced to meet in hotels out of view of Greeks who have accused monitors in the past of behaving like colonial overlords. “They haven’t been allowed into the general accountancy office and ministries,” said Jens Bastian, an Athens-based economics analyst and former member of the European commission task force for . “There’s been a certain lack of professionalism in the way they have been treated, one could call it rather confrontational,” he added.

2919	2920	Cabinet Office minister and deputy chief whip resign from government 	"David Cameron's long-serving deputy whip, John Randall, and his youngest minister, , have resigned ahead of a reshuffle in which the prime minister is expected to promote a number of women. Downing Street's surprise announcements sparked speculation that Cameron will shake up junior roles within his team as early as Monday. They follow the resignation of transport minister Simon Burns, who wants to stand as deputy Commons speaker, with rising stars such as Sajid Javid, Esther McVey and Nicky Morgan tipped for bigger jobs. Randall, who has served in the Tory whips' office for 13 years, said he informed the prime minister last year that he wanted to return to the backbenches. He is best known for his role in the resignation of his boss, Andrew Mitchell, the former chief whip, over the ""plebgate"" scandal just over a year ago. Randall passed on information about Mitchell's alleged behaviour after one of his constituents claimed to have witnessed the former minister swearing at police officers and calling them ""plebs"". Mitchell always strongly denied the accusations and the constituent turned out to be a serving officer, who was later arrested as part of a wider investigation into an alleged conspiracy. In his resignation letter, Randall assured the prime minister that he would continue to do ""whatever I can for you personally as well as for the party, the government and of course the country"". ""I know that it is customary to write at these times that it has been a great privilege and honour to serve as a member of the government, but it really has been that and a lot more,"" he wrote. ""I have served 13 years in the whips' office both in opposition and more recently in government and I have served under and with some fantastic colleagues, notably Patrick [McLoughlin] and Sir George [Young], who have made the job extremely worthwhile and even fun."" Cameron's reply to Randall was glowing, describing him as a ""rock"" for the whips' office and the parliamentary party. ""It sounds dramatic, but I had rather hoped this day would never come,"" Cameron wrote. ""I could not have wished for a more loyal, discreet, patient, trustworthy and committed colleague over the last eight years since I became leader of the party, but you have been all these and much more."" Smith, a Cabinet Office minister, is stepping down to concentrate on her constituency work and engaging young people in politics. The 31-year-old MP, who has previously served as a whip and a Treasury minister, has recently been overseeing the controversial lobbying bill, which has been criticised by charities and campaign groups as posing a potential threat to freedom of speech. She was moved from the Treasury in the last reshuffle shortly after a difficult interview on BBC Newsnight about the chancellor's deferral of fuel duty. Smith, the MP for Norwich North, told the Guardian that her choice to step down was ""to do with priorities and what's most important"". ""Essentially, it's entirely my own decision and something I see as very positive,"" she said. ""Anyone who has known me and my work has known that my constituency comes first. It's the case that I've spent three of my four years in parliament serving as a minister. I'm very proud of that and achieving various things, like helping to save £10bn pounds of Whitehall waste. But for now I want to focus on the things that really matter to me."" In her resignation letter to Cameron, she said: ""As you know, I was only 27 when I was lucky enough to be elected as an MP, and of my four years in parliament so far, I have spent three as a minister. I would welcome the opportunity to develop other ways of giving public service, both inside and outside parliament, while continuing to work hard for my constituents."" The prime minister's reply said Smith has served ""ably"" and made a ""positive impact"". ""I know this will not have been an easy decision for you to make, and one you will have given a huge amount of thought to,"" he said. ""After serving the government so ably for over three years, you will certainly be missed, but I completely understand and respect your decision."" The Tory reshuffle could happen at the same time as shakes up the Labour frontbench. He is thought to be considering moving the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, and the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, with shadow Treasury minister Rachel Reeves tipped for promotion."

4249	4250	UK set to ban Google Glass for drivers 	" is the highest profile product in a wave of new wearable technologies, promising to display everything from restaurant reviews to directions and allow automated video and photos wherever we go. But the internet-connected eyewear looks set to be banned on the UK's roads even before the product's 2014 launch, according to the Department of Transport. A spokesman for the department told , a gadget magazine, that the device could distract drivers while they are behind the wheel, defining Glass as a similar distraction to a mobile phone. ""We are aware of the impending rollout of Glass and are in discussion with the police to ensure that individuals do not use this technology while driving,"" said the spokesman. ""It is important that drivers give their full attention to the road when they are behind the wheel and do not behave in a way that stops them from observing what is happening on the road."" He pointed to offences including driving without due attention and careless driving, which is due to become a fixed penalty offence in late 2013. Since a ban on using mobile phones while driving was introduced in 2003, more than one million drivers have been convicted – typically issued with a £60 fixed penalty notice and three points on their driver's licence. The statement by the Department for Transport indicates that Google Glass users would be subject to the same penalty under the 1988 Road Traffic Act. It reflects similar concerns in the US, where Glass has been launched to a small trial group of ""explorers"". Politicians in Delaware and West Virginia have that ban drivers wearing computing technologies while driving. ""We are thinking very carefully about how we design Glass because new technology always raises new issues,"" said Google in a statement. ""Our Glass Explorer programme, currently only launched in the US, reaches people from all walks of life and will ensure that our users become active participants in shaping the future of this technology."" Technology fans argue that Glass, which displays simple, monochrome information in the wearer's peripheral vision, is less distracting than satellite navigation tools that include a visual interface designed to be used while driving. Developers have already begun exploring applications for Glass, including , which allows owners of the high-end electric cars to remotely control the car's air conditioning, mileage and battery information as well as directions."

13966	13967	Cardiff City 3-2 Manchester City 	So much for Manuel Pellegrini insisting there was no chance of Manchester City underestimating Cardiff. There was little evidence that message got through to Pellegrini's players on an afternoon that was as chastening for as it was glorious for Cardiff. The Welsh club's first top-flight home game for 51 years will live long in the memory in these parts after two goals from Fraizer Campbell and another from Aron Gunnarsson delivered a thrilling victory. If the result would have been nigh on impossible to predict beforehand, it seemed even more unlikely after Edin Dzeko thumped a wonderful 25-yard shot beyond David Marshall seven minutes into the second half to give the visitors the lead. The natural assumption at that point was that Manchester City, who had looked strangely subdued in the first half, would go through the gears and take the game away from Cardiff. Nothing, however, could have been further from the truth. Cardiff played at a remarkable intensity in the opening 45 minutes and they summoned more courage and spirit to haul themselves back in the game when Gunnarsson swept home to equalise. From then on it was all about Campbell, who caused Manchester City's makeshift defence problems earlier on with his pace but ultimately did the damage here with his head. Campbell twice lost his marker Pablo Zabaleta to nod home from corners, with Joe Hart not exactly covering himself in glory on the first, when the England goalkeeper flapped at Peter Whittingham's delivery. The home team still had to endure a nervous finale. When Alvaro Negredo, a replacement for Dzeko, sent a towering header past Marshall in the second of six minutes of added time, Cardiff were hanging on. Negredo came close to pinching another in the closing seconds but the striker was unable to turn the ball home at the far post and with that chance Pellegrini's hopes of seeing his side salvage a point disappeared. There were raucous scenes at the final whistle as Cardiff supporters celebrated their first home win at this level since a West Ham United team containing Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters were vanquished 3-0 at Ninian Park in 1962. It was a sweet moment for Malky Mackay, his indefatigable players, the supporters who have been through some bleak times and Vincent Tan, the eccentric Cardiff owner who has caused controversy by changing the kit colour but also transformed the club's fortunes. Tan sanctioned £28.7m of spending this summer as Cardiff broke their transfer record three times, yet it was Campbell, a £600,000 signing from Sunderland in January, who stole the show. A surprise England debutant 18 months ago, when Stuart Pearce handed him a full cap against Holland, Campbell has never put forward a convincing case in the past that he belongs at this level. He had managed only seven goals in 70 appearances before the start of this season. By the end of the afternoon, however, the 25-year-old was reminding everyone why Sir Alex Ferguson held him in such high regard when he came through at Manchester United and Mackay was talking about the striker getting back into the England setup. The Cardiff fans certainly made their appreciation known when Campbell departed to a standing ovation in injury-time. For Pellegrini, the inquest will centre on City's poor defending – Joleon Lescott and Javier García never looked comfortable in central defence in the absence of the injured Vincent Kompany – and questions must now be asked about whether Hart is close to reaching that point when he has made one mistake too many. City were also poor in other departments. The fluidity and freedom that characterised their 4-0 win over Newcastle on Monday night was missing against a Cardiff side that worked tirelessly and got their tactics spot on. Mackay crowded the centre of the pitch with players when City had the ball, denying opponents that play narrow and with little natural width the chance to cut through them. On one of the few occasions when Cardiff stood off Manchester City, they were punished. Fernandinho rolled a ball into Sergio Agüero's feet and, with a deft backheel, the Argentinian found Dzeko, who dropped into a pocket of space about 25 yards out. One sumptuous swing of the right boot later and the ball was arching into the top corner of the net. Within eight minutes Cardiff were level. The impressive Kim Bo-kyung escaped on the right flank and delivered a low centre that Campbell swept towards goal. Hart blocked with his feet but Gunnarsson was first to the loose ball and gleefully rammed home. If that was not exactly in the script, it was nothing compared to what followed. Whittingham's corner sailed over the stranded Hart's head and Campbell got in front of Zabaleta, in the 79th minute, to nod in. Three minutes from time Campbell repeated the trick when the substitute Don Cowie delivered an inswinging corner from the opposite side of the pitch. Cardiff were in dreamland and although Negredo's superb header, from David Silva's cross, had a few hearts in mouths, Mackay's players held on for a remarkable win.

11351	11352	Ed Miliband blames rising bills on energy firms overcharging customers 	"Labour leader has dismissed the ""list of excuses"" offered to MPs by energy firms, blaming rising bills on them overcharging hard-pressed customers. He rejected the idea of a Competition Commission investigation into the market, saying ""nothing less than a price freeze"" would do. Miliband, whose promise to freeze bills for 20 months if wins the 2015 election has sent the issue to the top of the political agenda, said what was needed was action rather than a review. He told reporters: ""What we've heard today was a list of excuses from the energy companies."" Responding to chief executive Tony Cocker's call for a Competition Commission investigation, Miliband said: ""We don't need more excuses, more reviews, what we need is action. Action against companies that are overcharging people and taking advantage of a broken market. ""That's why it's so important that we implement Labour's price freeze, which is what we'll do, and reform a broken market so there's proper competition, proper transparency and a regulator who can cut prices for consumers."" He said green levies were not the reason for rising bills, but the charges should offer ""value for money"". Miliband said: ""We should always have value for money in whatever costs there are on bills. But when the companies and the government say that the problems of the cost of living crisis to do with energy aren't to do with overcharging, they are wrong. ""That's why I'll accept nothing less than a price freeze."" Miliband added: ""I think everybody knows by now that the market's not working. There are still some people who are trying to defend that broken market – the energy companies, this government – but I am determined we act. ""Frankly, hard-pressed families need someone who'll stand up for them. That's what I'm doing and that's what I'll do as prime minister."" Energy companies appearing before the energy and climate change select committee on Tuesday insisted the rises in bills were partly down to green taxes, but stood accused of charging customers ""the maximum price they feel they can get away with"". Rising wholesale costs and environmental ""stealth taxes"" were behind the average 9.1% rise announced by some major firms, the committee was told. But the businesses practices of the big six was called into question by small scale competitor Ovo Energy. Managing director Stephen Fitzpatrick told MPs he ""can't explain"" the price rises being imposed because his company was buying gas at a cheaper price – 5p a therm less – than it had in 2009. Loyal bill-payers are charged are a far higher rate, in some cases £200 more, than those who switch but the companies responsible go ""unchallenged"" by Ofgem, he said. ""It looks to me like a lot of energy companies, a significant number of the big six, are charging the maximum price they feel they can get away with to the customers that they feel will not switch under any circumstances and then maintaining the illusion of competitive pricing with tariffs targeted towards a very small number of relatively well-engaged customers,"" he told MPs. ""In the case of NPower, which is the worst offender, historically and today the price differential is about 16%, which is about £200."" He accused British Gas of being the most active in terms of running a dedicated ""win back team"" whose sole job was to call up customers that were leaving to say ""now we can cut your bill"". ""When this kind of behaviour is allowed to go unchallenged, and an ex-monopoly advantage that the big six have, is allowed to go unchallenged by Ofgem, then you will never get effective competition. ""If you don't have effective competition in a retail market then you are always going to be trying to find out where the money has gone and time and time again you will hear very clever, very complex, very confusing answers and you will never get to the bottom of it. ""Effective competition is the only solution to lower bills."" Fitzpatrick has previously suggested that the larger energy companies pay over the odds for energy when their retail arms buy from their own wholesale divisions – a claim the other energy bosses denied on Tuesday. Pressed on the allegation, Tony Cocker, chief executive officer of E.ON, said: ""We buy our electricity and our gas for the retail business from the market via our trading business. ""We operate our businesses on a standalone basis. ""There is absolutely no cross-subsidy between the businesses."" Cocker, who described green schemes as a ""stealth tax"" or ""poll tax"", said E.ON had not yet made a decision on whether to follow the other firms and increase prices. ""We will hold our prices as long as we can,"" he told the MPs, adding that his company faced the same pressures as the other firms, with rises in wholesale and network costs, as well as the social and environmental obligations. He has written to David Cameron calling for a Competition Commission investigation into the industry to be set up to help reassure customers. ""I fundamentally believe that this market is competitive but I acknowledge we are not trusted and therefore I believe we need to have a very thorough Competition Commission investigation,"" he said. William Morris, managing director of SSE, which has announced an 8.2% price rise, said he regretted having to increase bills for customers, who were ""struggling to maintain their budgets"". Transport costs had increased by 10%, while the government's environmental schemes had risen by 13%, he said. ""We would like to see those costs taken off the customers' bills and onto taxation. We welcome the government's decision to review that."" Morris said that companies would reduce bills as quickly as possible if the government decided to scrap the green taxes. Companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £60 if the green taxes were axed. Guy Johnson, external affairs director of Npower, which has announced average rises of 10.4%, said the largest driver of price rises had been the cost of the so-called climate obligation on power firms. The green taxes cover the period to March 2015, so the energy firms will have to fulfil a large part of their obligation next year, he said. ""That was a concern when we were considering prices for next year."" An analysis by industry regulator Ofgem showed that, while the increases announced so far this autumn by some of the companies have averaged 9.1%, wholesale prices have risen by 1.7% – adding just £10 to the average household bill of £600."

313	314	JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to be treated for throat cancer 	"JP Morgan Chase CEO , a feisty leader who steered the banking company through the perils of the Great Recession, is battling throat cancer. The condition is considered to be curable, according to a memo to Chase & Co employees and shareholders that Dimon released late Tuesday. Dimon, 58, said he plans to remain on the job and be actively involved in key decisions while undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatment. The eight-week treatment will begin soon at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York. The cancer remains confined to Dimon's throat and adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck, according to the memo. ""I feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes,"" Dimon said. Despite the words of reassurance, Dimon's illness could raise leadership concerns at one of the world's biggest banks. Those worries could be magnified by a recent succession of departures among high-ranking JP Morgan Chase executives once considered to be Dimon's potential successor. The list of defections have included former co-chief operating officer Frank Bisignano and former investment banking head Michael Cavanagh, who had been known as Dimon's ""Mr Fix-it."" JPMorgan's stock fell 37 cents to $57.20 in Tuesday's extended trading. Dimon, JPMorgan's CEO for the past eight-and-half years, won praise for his savvy in the aftermath of the mortgage-market meltdown that nearly toppled the banking industry before miring the U.S. in its deepest recession since World War II. His reputation, though, was tarnished in 2012 by the revelation of a stunning $6 billion loss triggered by risky bets made on complex debt securities by a JPMorgan trader in London. The setback, known as JPMorgan's ""London Whale,"" contributed to an unsuccessful shareholder campaign last year to separate the jobs of chairman and CEO — duties that Dimon still holds. JPMorgan also reached a settlement with the Justice Department last year that required the bank to pay $13bn to cover losses from the sale of toxic mortgages that later collapsed in value. Another legal settlement negotiated last year required JPMorgan to dole out $4.5bn to investors in bundles of shoddy home loans. JPMorgan said most of those troublesome mortgages were inherited from investment bank Bear Stearns and savings and loan Washington Mutual, companies that Dimon negotiated to buy during the financial crisis of 2008. Even amid public outrage over bankers' role in the mortgage meltdown, Dimon remained one of the industry's staunchest advocates. He supported big paydays for bankers and derided some of the U.S. government's proposed reforms designed to minimize the chances of another financial crisis. JPMorgan's stock is up 45% since Dimon took over the bank's helm on 31 December 2005. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has risen 58% in that period."	Business
9019	9020	Nicola Sturgeon: vote for SNP is not vote for second independence referendum 	Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that a vote for the Scottish National party in next month’s general election does not amount to a vote for a second referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP leader was speaking as she visited party activists in Aberdeen city centre in advance of Wednesday night’s second televised Scottish leaders’ debate. In a debate on STV on Tuesday, Sturgeon if it wins the 2016 Holyrood elections on a manifesto promising a second vote. Sturgeon was asked by broadcasters if she regretted mentioning the possibility of a second independence referendum during the debate, but she said she did not. Repeating her line that the timing of another referendum would be decided by public opinion, she said: “It’s ultimately up to the Scottish people. That’s the fundamental democratic point. I can’t impose it on the people against their will.” Sturgeon was booed by some parts of the audience when she said, when pressed by the host Bernard Ponsonby: “If the people of don’t vote for a party with a commitment in a manifesto to a referendum, there won’t be another referendum, that’s the point I’m making. The people are in charge, not politicians.” Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain within the UK last September, following a hard-fought campaign that saw support for independence reach an all-time high. In Aberdeen, she again refused to rule out including a referendum in the SNP’s manifesto for the 2016 Holyrood elections, saying: “It’s not reasonable to ask me to write the 2016 manifesto when we haven’t even written the 2015 one.” But she insisted: “A vote for the SNP is not a vote for another referendum. It is a vote to have Scotland’s voice heard at Westminster.” The debate on Wednesday, hosted by the BBC, is due to include the Scottish Green party leader, Patrick Harvie; Ukip’s David Coburn, the Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy; the Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie for the Liberal Democrats. Sturgeon was heckled by a group of Ukip supporters chanting “Ukip OK”, but they were swiftly drowned out by the boos of the assembled throng of SNP activists at Tuesday’s debate. She said that the back-to-back debates were a chance to put the case for Scotland’s voice being heard more loudly at Westminster. “I want to see an alternative to austerity, I want to see money being spent on the future of our children, not on new nuclear weapons.” she said. “I want more action to grow our economy and create jobs. I want to see a higher minimum wage. These are the kind of policies that a big SNP team in Westminster can help to bring about.” Murphy was also campaigning in Aberdeen ahead of the debate, highlighting the threat of further cuts to disability benefits.

2638	2639	Clegg attacks ‘us-versus-them’ narrative of Farage and Salmond 	British politics is threatened by a divisive “us-versus-them” approach championed by Nigel Farage and which offers a “false comfort of grievance” to voters, Nick Clegg has warned. In his speech to the in Glasgow, the deputy prime minister said the Ukip and SNP leaders are making “seductive and beguiling” offers that are no more than a “counsel of despair”. The strong attack on Farage and Salmond, the day before Ukip is likely to win its first Westminster seat in the Clacton byelection, was designed to highlight Clegg’s main pre-election pitch that he leads the only UK party rooted in the centre ground. But the deputy prime minister also directly addressed one of his main personal weaknesses – that he is untrustworthy after his U-turn on university tuition fees – when he admitted that he had damaged trust in politics. Promising that he would “never, ever” make the same mistake again, Clegg said: “In what might be the least fashionable statement made by any party leader this conference season – politicians of every party have fed this growing cynicism by exaggerating and overstating what governments can do. We’ve all done it. I’ve been there. When I apologised for the disappointment and anger caused by our inability to scrap tuition fees, I knew we could never, ever make that mistake again.” In his speech Clegg also: Attacked the home secretary, Theresa May, for suggesting that Lib Dem opposition to the so called “snooper’s charter” is risking the safety of children. “Stop playing party politics with national security,” he told May as he warned that a “big brother state” demanding the storage of information on websites people visit is as threatening as a state that fails to protect children. Accused the Tories of assuming that every worry in the world can be solved by a “big wave of the Union Jack” as he condemned George Osborne’s plan to penalise the working age poor by planning to freeze benefits. Warned that Ed Miliband is promising an unrealistic “nirvana where everyone will be well-off, no one will be out of pocket”. Clegg opened his speech with a strong condemnation of Islamic State whose beheading of Alan Henning and David Haines had given British military forces a “clear single objective”. He said: “To Isil we say this: all you have done is unite the people of Britain – Muslim and non-Muslim, people of all faiths and none – around a single aim. All you have done is give the British forces who are being deployed to Iraq – some of the best professionals in the world – a clear, single objective.” Clegg hailed the result of the Scottish referendum as he quoted the comic pub landlord Al Murray who told the pro-UK rally in Trafalgar Square that there was something wonderfully vague about being British which he called “Brit-Ish”. But the deputy prime minister had harsh words for Salmond and for Farage for seeking to promote a divisive form of politics. He said: “Something very un-British is taking root in our politics. A growing movement of people who want to pull us apart. Salmond, Farage, the bitter tribalism of left and right – in their different ways they’re all doing the same thing. A growing pick-a-side politics, in a world of us-versus-them. Worried about your job? Your business? Your children’s future? Your way of life? No matter, just blame Europe/Brussels/foreigners/immigrants/the English/the South/professional politicians/Westminster/big business/anybody claiming benefits/even onshore wind farms. “Life is so simple when you know who – or what – to blame. It’s seductive and it’s beguiling. That much may even be proved tomorrow, if the people of Clacton give the UK Independence Party an MP. But resentment, the politics of fear, doesn’t pay the bills or create a single job. Claiming to address people’s acute anxiety about the modern world, it provides nothing but the false comfort of grievance. Dressed up as the politics of hope, it is in fact a counsel of despair.”	Politics
10744	10745	Sepp Blatter has spoken: the vote goes on and Qatar will host 2022 World Cup 	"t the $100m headquarters has built for Fifa high on a hill above Zurich, the president of football's world governing body mounted a defiant, embattled and, at points, irritable defence as a tide of corruption allegations lapped at the Fifa gates. When repeating his overarching argument, that he regards as untouchable even by governments, accountable only to its own ""family within"", Blatter even came close to using the phrase Crisis? What crisis? Asked if this is indeed a crisis for Fifa, with two executive committee members suspended and one, , threatening to unleash a ""tsunami"" against Fifa which began on Sunday night with allegations of impropriety against Blatter himself, the president said: ""Crisis? What is a crisis? Football is not in a crisis. We are only in some difficulties, and the difficulties will be solved within the football family."" Despite the extraordinary fallout which has involved 10 of Fifa's 24 executive committee members, including Blatter himself, being accused of corruption offences, Blatter's stance of invincibility remains true. He rejected any suggestion of postponing the presidential election at Wednesday's Fifa's annual congress. There, with his challenger, the Qatari , having withdrawn and now been suspended pending an investigation into an alleged cash-for-votes bribery scandal, Blatter is certain to be waved in, unopposed, for his fourth four-year term as president. The Swiss government is investigating whether it should maintain tax advantages and immunity from anti-corruption treaties which international sports governing bodies, long clustered in the country, enjoy. A British Conservative MP, Damian Collins, on Monday called on politicians around the world to sign up to his five-plank campaign for change at Fifa. But a long-term inquiry in Switzerland and one backbench MP do not constitute pressure great enough to overhaul Fifa. Blatter's performance was an effort to draw Fifa back in line, calling for ""unity and solidarity"" – with him as head of the family. Blatter brushed aside the claim from Warner, a member of the executive committee and president of the Concacaf grouping of Central American, North America and Caribbean football associations, that Blatter had given $1m (£600,000) in cash to Concacaf, and laptops and computers to 13 Caribbean associations, by implication in return for votes. Warner had said the $1m was for Concacaf ""to spend as it wished"", but Blatter replied that in fact it was for two football development projects under Fifa's flagship programme, Goal. Whether the president of Fifa, a month before an election, should really be handing out $1m cheques to voting confederations, and whether, as Michel Platini, president of European football's governing body, Uefa, said on Monday, Blatter does have ""his own budget"" for Goal, were questions not asked or answered. Doubts have long been expressed about the Goal money, which Fifa distributes to its 208 member associations from its vast income, $1.3bn last year, for selling the World Cup commercial rights. There are accusations it is not accountable enough, and too often in reality amounts to largesse dispensed globally to cement Blatter's regime in Zurich. Warner's allegations, made in fury after his suspension was announced by Fifa's ethics committee, included the allegation that in an email to Warner, Jerome Valcke, Fifa's general secretary, had said, almost casually, that ""bought"" the hosting of the 2022 World Cup. That tore open again the rumbling controversy over how Qatar, the tiny but oil and gas-rich Gulf state, won the right to host the 2022 tournament. Valcke attempted a clarification of that incendiary comment with a statement issued just before Blatter's press conference, saying: ""What I wanted to say is that the winning bid used their financial strength to lobby for support. I have at no time made, or was intending to make, any reference to any purchase of votes or similar unethical behaviour."" In his email to Warner, which Warner exposed, Valcke appeared to be witheringly dismissive of Bin Hammam's presidential election candidacy, and wondered whether the Qatari believed he could ""buy Fifa as they [Qatar] bought the WC"". After Qatar were awarded the tournament in December, allegations followed of vote-sharing with Spain, forbidden in the Fifa rules. Then the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee published evidence from the Sunday Times quoting a Qatari whistleblower saying two African Fifa executive committee members, Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma, had been paid bribes to vote for Qatar. Both men denied that, and the Qatar bid team issued a detailed rejection. On Monday Blatter made great play of the fact that he was appearing before the massed ranks of the international media alone – with Valcke absent. Asked about Valcke's comment and the clarification, Blatter refused to discuss it. But he maintained, again, that there will be no investigation or reopening of the bidding process. ""There was no problem for Fifa's executive committee to act, and there is no issue for the World Cup 2022,"" Blatter insisted. Warner had raged in his own statement that the bribery charges against him and Bin Hammam, which led to their suspension, were ""politically motivated"" to secure Blatter's re-election, and he made a dark threat. ""I intend to say a lot more on this matter shortly."" Fifa is bracing itself for further revelations, from the inside, as Warner has been at the heart of Fifa, on the executive committee, for 28 years, working closely with Blatter. Blatter did say he will seek reforms to Fifa's ""governance and compliance"" after the deluge of scandals. He held up a thin, glossy leaflet for the cameras, and said: ""This is our ethics code. I am not sure everybody in the Fifa family has read it."" Then he was gone, still the leader of world football, after all that has happened, untouchable, and cruising to four more years."	Football
2727	2728	SSE to cut dual fuel bills by 3.5% from March 	" became the latest energy firm to announce savings from the government's green levy shake-up with plans to cut dual fuel prices by 3.5% from 24 March. The bill reduction will apply to all SSE's 9.5 million residential customers, including those on fixed or capped deals. But it will only scale back the 8.2% average tariff rise that kicked in on 15 November and the change will also take effect nearly three months after rival British Gas dropped prices in response to the government's move to cut the cost of green levies on customer bills. SSE's announcement follows ScottishPower's decision on Monday to reduce dual fuel prices by 3.3% from 31 January. Npower is now the only ""big six"" provider not to reveal price changes following the green levy deal, although it has already pledged to cut prices. Labour last week called on ScottishPower, npower and SSE to immediately reduce prices for households after the government said it would cut the cost of the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and asked electricity distribution companies to take action to reduce network costs. British Gas has already reduced prices, announcing in early December that it would lower bills by 3.2% on New Year's Day, effectively reducing hikes that saw prices go up by 10.4% for electricity and 8.4% for gas in November. EDF and E.ON took the levy changes into account in the recent round of price rises, increasing tariffs on average by 3.9% and 3.7% respectively – far less than the increases announced by rivals. But SSE's delay comes as it said it was not expecting the ECO savings to start coming through until April. Like other suppliers, it will also hand a £12 rebate to all electricity customers for the Warm Home Discount, to be funded through general taxation, which together with the price cut will shave around £50 off the average annual dual fuel bill, to £1,174. SSE said it would cap prices at the new, lower level until spring 2015, as long as there were no major increases in wholesale energy costs, network or policy costs."	Business
1149	1150	Sainsbury’s cuts sales forecast and reviews dividend 	The UK’s supermarkets are facing a “perfect storm” of problems, the new boss of Sainsbury’s said as he revealed a slump in sales and warned that the changes under way in the food retail business were the most challenging he had seen in his 30-year career. Just days after announcing a new round of price cuts intended to fend off growing competition from fast-growing discounters including Aldi and Lidl, the Sainsbury’s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said the pace of change in shoppers’ behaviour had accelerated rapidly over the summer. “It’s the most challenging I’ve ever seen the market in my 30 years in retail. A combination of effects have created a perfect storm,” Coupe said. A sea change in shoppers’ behaviour is under way, the scale of which some retail executives and analysts have likened to the arrival of self-service supermarkets in the 1960s. , Morrisons and Sainsbury’s are all seeing sales decline sharply as customers shun superstores and big weekly shopping expeditions in favour of shopping more locally and more often. They are also looking for better deals, trying new retailers, buying less and wasting less. Online shopping is also growing rapidly. Those trends are boosting the discounters – especially Aldi, Lidl and Poundland – and convenience stores, rather than the traditional big supermarkets. is the only one of the big four grocers gaining market share – and its gains are tiny compared with those of the discounters. The Walmart-owned chain cut its prices sooner than its rivals, which are only now realising they must respond. “These are trends that are here to stay,” said Coupe. “Customers have never been more savvy or shopping around more.” It was Coupe’s first update to the City since he replaced Justin King as boss in July. He said Sainsbury’s was carrying out a complete review of its business to find a way to fight back: “We are looking at all aspects of our business. We will leave no stone unturned.” The company said it was not standing still in the face of new competition but was opening more convenience stores and improving its online service, both of which were seeing sales rise. It also plans to fight the discounters head on through a deal with the Danish discounter Netto to open Netto shops in the UK. The first five will open at the beginning of next month. However, more than £1bn was wiped off the value of the UK’s three publicly listed supermarkets – Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Tesco – yesterday as Coupe admitted that Sainsbury’s takings would continue to decline in the coming months. Sainsbury’s shares slumped nearly 7% to their lowest level in 11 years. Retail analysts at the City broker Shore Capital slashed their full-year profits forecasts for Sainsbury’s by 17% to £650m. If Sainsbury’s shares fall just 17p from yesterday’s 234p close, they will be back to their level in 1989. Investors have also been spooked by the £250m accounting scandal at Tesco in relation to the allocation of payments from suppliers, which is being investigated by the City watchdog. But Coupe and Sainsbury’s finance chief, John Rogers, insisted they were “100% confident” that Sainsbury’s had accounted for promotional income correctly. Rogers said it was “a gross misrepresentation” that retailers had lots of leeway about how and when to record such income. The accounting rules, he insisted, were clearly defined. Retail experts had been braced for bad news on sales and Sainsbury’s confirmed those fears. Like-for-like sales – which measure only stores open for a full year to exclude gains made from opening new shopfloor space – dropped by 2.8% over the past four months. In the previous three months, sales declined by 1.1%. Before that Sainsbury’s had recorded nine years of unbroken quarterly sales growth. Coupe insisted that Sainsbury’s was outperforming Tesco and Morrisons, both of which have seen sales dive more sharply. But Darren Shirley, an analyst at Shore Capital, said this was hardly an achievement. “Should Sainsbury’s be comparing itself with the two weakest performers in the market?” he asked Morrisons has been forced to accept a 50% cut in its profits in order to slash prices on more than 1,200 items after it began losing sales to discount stores. Tesco is in turmoil after replacing its chief executive and finance director after a big slump in performance in the UK and overseas. The UK’s biggest retailer has found itself hindered by its reliance on very large supermarkets which are now out of fashion. “You could argue that with Tesco underperforming to that degree, Sainsbury’s should be benefiting – and they are not,” Shirley said.

2046	2047	Calvin Harris' Summer single is a million-dollar hit on Spotify 	Streaming music service Spotify says the aptly-named Summer by was its “song of the summer” this year, after its users streamed the track more than 160m times since its release in June. Announced as part of a wider release about summer hits on the service – Harris beat Ariana Grande and Iggy Azalea’s Problem to top spot on Spotify’s chart – the feat becomes more interesting when you dig in to how much money Summer’s streams made for Harris. The short answer: nobody knows, because the exact amount will depend on the terms of his label and publishing contracts. But we can at least calculate roughly how much those rightsholders were paid for streams of the song. in 2013, including the claim that its average “per stream” payout is between $0.006 and $0.0084. Those figures cover payments to labels, publishers and distributors, who then pass them on to artists and songwriters. According to the , Harris’ Summer has been played 160,753,376 times, at the time of writing. That means a payout of between $964k and $1.35m so far. Or, if you take the mid-point between the two per-stream amounts: around $1.16m (around £706k). It’s a million-dollar hit on , at least, since these figures don’t include payments for streams of the track on YouTube (42.7m plays of the audio-only version and another 189.1m of the actual video) or other streaming services. Global download sales of Summer are unknown. Only Harris will know how much of Summer’s streaming payout comes through to him, and even he won’t know for a while, since royalty payments don’t tend to zip through the music industry system at a rollercoaster pace. These calculations don’t prove the arguments of Spotify’s keenest supporters or fiercest foes regarding streaming’s pros and cons for musicians: you could spin the figures either way, depending on your existing view. But the numbers are an insight into the scale of payouts for the biggest hits on this particular streaming service – although Summer has a way to go to catch up with Avicii’s Wake Me Up, which with 277.1m streams so far remains the biggest hit on Spotify.

121	122	YouTube to block indie labels who don't sign up to new music service 	"Independent artists could disappear from ""in a matter of days"" after the Google video service confirmed it was dropping content from independent labels that have not signed up for its upcoming subscription music service. YouTube is about to begin testing the new service – which will charge people to watch and listen to music without ads, and download songs to their mobile devices – within the next few days, initially within . The company's head of content and business operations, Robert Kyncl, that the service – previously rumoured to be called YouTube Music Pass – will launch more widely later in the year. His confirmation that YouTube will block videos from labels that do not sign licensing deals for the new premium tier will be hugely controversial among indie labels, with trade body WIN already filing a complaint to the European Commission about its negotiating strategy. ""While we wish that we had 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience,"" said Kyncl, claiming that YouTube has signed up labels representing 90% of the music industry. Independent labels are likely to disagree. Their licensing agency Merlin estimates that of the recorded music industry's sales and streams. Contacted by The Guardian following his comments, WIN's chief executive Alison Wenham was blunt in her response. ""They have suffered a simple but catastrophic error of judgement in misreading the market,"" said Wenham, who had to protest at YouTube's plans. Wenham said YouTube was ""setting itself up for failure"" and only a small number of independent labels would agree to its terms. ""We have tried and will continue to try to help YouTube understand just how important independent music is to any streaming service and why it should be valued accordingly. Music fans want a service that offers the complete range of music available. This is something that companies such as Spotify and Deezer do, both of whom have excellent relationships with the independent music sector,"" she said. WIN claims that the company has signed lucrative licensing deals with major labels Universal, Warner and Sony, while demanding that independent labels sign up to inferior terms or face having their videos blocked from YouTube's free service. “Our goal is to continue making YouTube an amazing music experience, both as a global platform for fans and artists to connect, and as a revenue source for the music industry,” a Google spokesman said. He said the subscription-based service would bring new revenue streams “in addition to the hundreds of millions of dollars YouTube already generates for them each year. We are excited that hundreds of major and independent labels are already partnering with us.” Wenham's criticism echoes a claim made at the event by musician Billy Bragg, who said ""I don’t know why they’ve opened this hornet’s nest right now, apart from corporate hubris. I don’t think they realise what a stupid thing they’ve done."" Artists including Adele, Arctic Monkeys and Jack White could see their videos taken down. The site has become a key promotional outlet for independent labels of all sizes in recent years. YouTube attracts more than 1bn monthly viewers, with music one of its biggest categories. Its upcoming premium music subscription tier will compete with Spotify, Deezer and Napster among other services, including Apple-owned Beats Music and Google's own Google Play Music All Access. Independent labels have long complained that they deserve more respect from digital music services negotiating licensing deals, and set up Merlin to strike deals on their behalf. The agency has remained silent throughout the recent arguments about YouTube's planned new service, although its chief executive Charles Caldas in late April. Referring to an earlier quote from Bragg suggesting that musicians unhappy about royalties paid by Spotify should be ""marching to YouTube central with flaming pitchforks"", Caldas said: ""I can’t say Billy’s right, but I can say that he’s not wrong."" The move comes as Amazon too has begun to flex its muscles in ways that limit the content its customers can receive. Amazon is delaying shipments and , publisher of Harry Potter author JK Rowling, and home to David Baldacci, Stephen Colbert, David Foster Wallace and others. It has also for forthcoming Warner Home Video features, including international blockbuster The Lego Movie, 300: Rise of an Empire, Winter’s Tale and Transcendence. "	Technology
8743	8744	Hillsborough: 20 years on, Liverpool has still not forgiven the newspaper it calls 'The Scum' 	"The front page of Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper read ""96 Tears"" on Thursday, the headline over a story about the previous day's moving tribute to the Hillsborough dead. Not that many people on Merseyside saw it. The newspaper, which has a circulation of more than 3m nationally, sold just 8,000 copies in the area on the day of the memorial service at Anfield, which was attended by more than 30,000 people. Inside the newspaper, still known as ""The Scum"" in Liverpool, ""lifelong fan"" David Wooding, the Whitehall editor, delivered a poignant tribute to the men, women and children who lost their lives. But for those who gathered at Anfield this week, it was far too little and far too late. At the Albert pub, squeezed next to the ground, football scarves and Liverpool memorabilia cover the walls and ceiling. The entrance of the pub has a poster mocking the front page of the Sun's notorious splash, which appeared a few days after the tragedy. The tabloid's masthead appears to be dripping in blood. ""The truth,"" it reads. ""96 dead. Hillsborough 15th April 1989. Don't buy the Sun."" Tommy Doran, who works at the Albert, remembers one regular reading the Sun in a corner of the pub. ""I went over to him and said: 'What's that?' and he went: 'The Sun.' I just ripped it up into pieces in front of him."" Like many others on Merseyside, Doran will never forgive the decision of then editor Kelvin MacKenzie to lead on 19 April 1989 with a story headlined ""The Truth"" that was anything but. In it, quoting unnamed police sources and a Tory MP, it claimed drunken Liverpool fans urinated on and picked the pockets of the dead, hampered rescue efforts and attacked policemen. Lord Taylor's subsequent report into the tragedy later made it clear that it was the decision to open a gate to ease a crush outside the ground and a failure to direct fans away from the central pen once inside that was the main cause. The Sun's slurs still linger and, according to some relatives of the victims, hampered a fight for justice that goes on to this day. The hatred they feel for the paper still burns fiercely and the Sun has all but given up trying to repair relations. Sun reporters know they will never get exclusives from former players who remember the disaster and its effect. Current players such as Steven Gerrard, who lost a cousin in the disaster, are similarly aware of the sensitivities involved. Some at the paper believe it became the target for the anger of fans partly because of the failure of officials to accept responsibility. Managing editor Graham Dudman wrote two weeks ago: ""Despite some members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group publicly accepting our apology, it made little difference on Merseyside where the community has to live with the knowledge that no police officer or ground official was ever convicted for the mistakes that led to the tragedy."" For most, the time for apologies has long gone. Tom Hughes, a Liverpool fan, said: ""I would never buy it and people round here won't buy it again for another 20 years. It has gone too far. There has been the apology from Kelvin MacKenzie then he took it back saying he was forced to apologise. What does that say to people?"" Mackenzie admitted the story was a ""fundamental mistake"" before a Commons committee in 1993. But at a private lunch in 2006, he suggested he had only apologised because Rupert Murdoch forced him to and was quoted as saying: ""All I did wrong was tell the truth ... I was not sorry then and I'm not sorry now."" In 2004, there was a concerted push by the Sun to try to move on from what it called ""the most terrible mistake in its history"" but many agreed with the Liverpool Echo's condemnation of it as a ""cynical and shameless"" exercise. Dudman went to Liverpool for informal talks with members of the Hillsborough Families Support Group but a formal approach to speak to the group was rejected. ""Do you forgive Hitler for what he's done? Does anybody forgive Pol Pot? We are not God,"" said Margaret Aspinall, who lost her 18-year-old son at Hillsborough. ""I cannot forgive people like that. And that Sun newspaper, may God forgive them - not me."" Kelvin MacKenzie ignores the pleas of senior colleagues and plumps for a front page headline reading The Truth, with three sub-headings: ""Some fans picked pockets of victims; Some fans urinated on the brave cops; Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life"". MacKenzie is persuaded by Rupert Murdoch to apologise. Appearing in front of a Commons select committee, MacKenzie said: ""I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what a (Tory) MP said."" After the Sun pays Wayne Rooney a six-figure sum for a series of exclusive interviews following Euro 2004, he is criticised in his home town of Liverpool. In response, the Sun carries a full page apology for ""the most terrible mistake in its history"" but also claims the campaign has been stirred up by the Trinity Mirror-owned Liverpool Echo. At a private business lunch at a Newcastle law firm MacKenzie is reported to have retracted his apology: ""I wasn't sorry then and I'm not sorry now because we told the truth."" MacKenzie, appearing on Question Time, says he shouldn't have to apologise. ""The issue about it is that story has become so caught up in a battle ... that actually no matter what I said would resolve the issue."""	Football
14625	14626	Mhairi Black: the 20-year-old student poised to unseat Douglas Alexander 	A self-confessed political “geek” and football obsessive, Mhairi Black – like any university student – is happier in jeans than in the smart business suits she is having to get used to wearing. “My mum insisted,” said the 20-year-old. “We went shopping the minute I was selected.” In the concrete car park directly across from the ancient abbey of Paisley – resting place of the royal house of Stuart and a place where 19th-century radicals once plotted an overthrow of the government – Black’s supporters are more warmly dressed in Puffa jackets and scarves. The evening sunshine is giving way to drizzle and a chilly wind. Black must be freezing as she takes out her Scottish National party rosette and pins it to her lapel, but beams warmly. “Right, at least its drier than last night. So where are we going?” If the pollsters are accurate, Black could be going all the way to Westminster. , Black is 8% ahead of her rival. Victory would be a remarkable feat and make the SNP candidate for Paisley and Renfrewshire South the youngest ever MP, as well as overturn the 16,610 majority of one of Labour’s biggest hitters in Scotland, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander. Referring to its radical traditions, Benjamin Disraeli once said: “Keep your eye on Paisley.” Students of political upsets would do well to heed the advice on 7 May. As Black canvasses round an estate of modern terraced houses in central Paisley, a town some seven miles west of Glasgow, everyone who answers their door has an opinion. “You’re kind of young to be taking on a big gun,” said Joseph Findlay, a lifelong voter. But he’s prepared to listen and takes the literature he’s offered. “I think the SNP will win round here,” he said. “As long as David Cameron is put out, that’s the main thing.” Findlay is the only one who mentions her age, but everyone has something to say – about welfare, the NHS, dirty pavements, tax, even euthanasia. Though slightly startled by her own trajectory, Black is not remotely surprised by the SNP surge. “People have been battered by a system that doesn’t care about them and they’ve had enough of austerity,” she said. “You can feel the frustration that people have, that the principles have been abandoned by Labour. My dad is a lifelong Labour voter: my family was all proper Clydeside-shipyards Labour. But my grandfather would turn in his grave if he heard how Labour were behaving now: the bitterness in them. The intellect of the party has fallen, the principles of the party have fallen. They started taking people for granted. My dad and I joined the SNP on the same day. Labour have never had to campaign here, so I wanted to stand to force to do just that.” Alexander, in charge of Labour’s national election strategy, knows he is in a battle now. The membership of the SNP has tripled in the past six months to more than 106,000 – the party claims 1,200 people signed up during Thursday’s television leadership debate in which its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, starred. It has become the third largest party by membership in Britain. For Black, the legacy of Scotland’s in/out referendum is a renewed political energy and determination, and a growing self-confidence among those who want to shape its own destiny. “It took a day or two to lick my wounds, and then I just thought: right, what can I do now? And a lot of people were like that. People had a confidence, that capability. You knew that you could be a painter and decorator and know more about what needs to be done in this society than anyone in a suit in Westminster. Because you know what it is to be skint and to live with the anxieties of that in your life. That’s what the Labour party used to stand for. We don’t need to be millionaires, we just want to be making a decent living and having our views listened to. “It’s about making a noise, whether writing to your MP or going on a march. I’ve got a lot of friends who live in England who are really jealous of what’s happening in Scotland, who would love to be part of something like this.” My grandfather would turn in his grave if he heard how Labour were behaving now: the bitterness in them Black tackled the selection process in the way she is tackling the election: singlemindedly. The first girl in her primary school to be selected for the football team, she clearly has determination and drive. But it was just a day after her selection that the first hard political knock came. In what seems an oversight by the SNP PR machine, Black’s Twitter account still held tweets from when she was a teenager. During an especially tense match between her beloved Partick Thistle and rivals Celtic, she had tweeted: “I’ve only just realised – I really f***** hate Celtic” and “Celtic, yer a joke! #scum.” “Yes, making the front page was a surprise,” she said ruefully. “My brother came through and said: ‘Have you seen this?’ But then he said: ‘You got a bit heated during a football match. Tony Blair started a war. Let’s put it in perspective.’ “So it was a shock to the system, but you have to think about what your political opponents are doing, trawling through to find old messages written by a teenager and holding them relevant in a country where 100,000 children are living below the poverty line. Maybe their priorities are a bit skewed.” That wasn’t the end of the controversy. At a post-referendum rally, Black described being at the count and walking past “all these fatcat Labour councillors goading us, clapping sarcastically, saying ‘better luck next time’ or ‘hard lines’. It took everything, every fibre in my being, not to put the nut in one of them.” Unfortunately for her, the cameras were rolling. “Of course, I regret that turn of phrase,” she says now. “That day, after two years of work, of course it was emotional. And no, I wasn’t about to headbutt anyone.” On his doorstep, Paisley voter Joseph Findlay is impressed with Black. He’s never before voted SNP, but he’s now considering it, disillusioned with Labour. “I think they judged it wrong, they scared people and that’s not right. There’s a lot regretting it now. “I voted Labour all my life, my wife voted no in the referendum, and I voted yes. She’s riddled with guilt now she sees that nothing has changed. We’re both not decided yet for the general election but I think the SNP are going to win around here. “Us oldyins haven’t done much to put up a fight, so now the younger ones are getting out and doing it for themselves.” He peers round his doorframe at the departing figure of Black, off to “chap” his neighbour’s door. “Very good luck to the lassie.” If the directness of the voters around here is anything to go by, there is no tolerance for the status quo. Alexander may yet pull back some of his party’s deserters before the vote, but there is a new wave of post-referendum politicised Scots who won’t make it easy. Black refuses to even think about losing. “I’m fighting this election day by day, talking to as many people as I possibly can. I want to change things, that’s what people are demanding. You can feel it bubbling – the frustration and the anger.”	Politics
3975	3976	Arsenal 2-1 Barcelona 	Arsenal may not have won the tie but they approach the return with a serenity that is no longer within Barcelona's reach. The visitors lost a lead and then the match. In that run of events an initially effortless side became careless and vulnerable. They ought to reproach themselves and there is now penance enough in a return at the Camp Nou that will be stressful for Barcelona no matter how it is eventually resolved. For the time being Arsène Wenger can settle for feeling proud of the maturity of Arsenal players whose temperaments did not shrivel even when were at their most intimidatingly fluent. Instead Arsenal persevered in looking for weaknesses and eventually located them. Robin van Persie tied the score in the 78th minute with a drive from a tight angle on the left that ought never to have beaten Víctor Valdés at his near post. There was further proof to come of Barcelona fallibility. Five minutes later Cesc Fábregas set Samir Nasri moving on the right and the cut-back was swept home perfectly by the substitute Andrey Arshavin. Barcelona had come as close as seems feasible to resembling normal, intermittently accident-prone human beings. Chances were squandered as if it could be taken for granted that there would be many more to come for Lionel Messi and others. That assumption turned out to be a delusion and now there are matters of bare fact to occupy them. The centre-half Gerard Piqué was booked and will be suspended for the second leg. The Barcelona manager, Pep Guardiola, must therefore hope that the captain Carles Puyol's recovery from a knee injury does not falter between now and 8 March. There was proof in abundance of Barcelona's technique and imagination, yet they were not ruthless in taking the full benefit. They had been 2-0 ahead here a year ago before drawing the first leg of the quarter-final but went on to rout 4-1 in the return. That may account for the complacency when Barcelona neglected to drive home the advantage of David Villa's opener last night. Arsenal's emergence as the single likely challenger to Manchester United for the Premier League title ought to have told Barcelona that there is more of an edge to Wenger's men nowadays. With an away goal recorded in a narrow defeat Guardiola's side deserve to remain favourites for the quarter-finals but that assertion is open to more debate now than anyone anticipated. Meeting Barcelona is a predicament for virtually all teams but Arsenal's case is unusual. Rather than being the normal contrast of styles, this encounter saw Guardiola's side taking on opponents who would like nothing better than to emulate their methods. Arsenal withstood that comparison. Even when the visitors took the lead through Villa in the 26th minute it came in a spell where they might just as easily have fallen behind. Neither team was particularly convincing when seeking to thwart the other. Their heart is not in such work. That openness made for a frenetic yet also adroit spectacle. Barcelona could well have had a lovingly crafted opener after a quarter of an hour. Andrés Iniesta picked out Messi and he laid the ball back to Villa before breaking free on the return. It may only have been the wish to take the goal with a flourish that undermined him as a dinked shot went beyond the far post. Arsenal were at least as effective then in unpeeling a back four. Following good work by Theo Walcott, Fábregas lobbed a pass to Van Persie, who rattled a shot that was saved by Valdés. Even if Wenger's men blundered in their effort to spring the offside trap, Messi sending Villa in for the opener, Arsenal had been trying to dictate the terms of the match and so break a Barcelona rhythm that is as natural as a pulse. There had been indications from early moments that Barcelona are less sure in defence without Puyol. In that aspect the visitors could be seen as fallible human beings. They were not in full command when a run like Walcott's unpeeled the right side of the defence in the 55th minute, although his low ball was cleared. There was enough disquiet in Barcelona for Piqué to receive his yellow card, after bringing down Fábregas. There was a gathering conviction to Arsenal and, in consequence, the odd indication of alarm in the visitors as the second half assumed its shape. It took 20 minutes or more before Barcelona enjoyed a studied period of possession as they probed around the edges of the Arsenal penalty area. Two substitutions reflected managerial outlooks. Guardiola's preference was conservative, as Seydou Keita took over from Villa, while Wenger pitched on the creative Arshavin for the holding midfielder Alex Song. The match had turned pensive. That was natural after two sides who had regularly swept around this pitch realised that they resemble normal footballers in one respect. They, too, can get very tired. Arsenal still mustered a perseverance that took them to victory.	Football
14096	14097	Tories winning economy 'blame game' – poll 	"In the run-up to next week's budget, the retain a commanding lead on the economic ""blame game"" and appear to be containing the Ukip insurgency, according to a Guardian/ICM poll. Westminster voting intentions have changed little , with Labour still ahead on 38% and the Conservatives creeping up one point to 35%, narrowing Ed Miliband's lead to just three points. But Ukip, which has had exceptional exposure in the run-up to May's European elections, not all of it flattering, has dropped back two points to 9%. As Nick Clegg prepares to , the Lib Dems have clawed back two points from their 16-year low in . Clegg's party's rise to 12% has pushed Farage's party back into fourth place. It is only the third time since George Osborne's ""omnishambles"" 2012 budget that the Tories have hit 35% or more in the monthly series of polls. David Cameron's relatively solid standing today comes after months of good economic news: and inflation for the first time in four years. In these circumstances, voters appear to be in a forgiving mood about the preceding years of disappointing financial news and the continuing cuts. ICM asked who or what was ""most to blame for Britain's recent economic difficulties and the ongoing cutbacks in government spending"", and found that twice as many voters (32%) blamed ""debts racked up by the last government"" as the ""coalition's economic management"" (16%). Labour has during the course of this parliament, and the gap between government and opposition on this score is now the widest it has been since 2010. Labour's 16-point deficit represents a substantial widening of the six-point gap found the last time a similarly worded question was put in . More people (20%) now blame the banks than the coalition, while the proportion of voters who identify the eurozone as the principal culprit (14%) is nearly as high as those who point the finger at the government. While the Financial Times has warned that Osborne in his accounts, the poll is a propitious political backdrop for a chancellor preparing to open his budget red box next Wednesday. But the survey contains warnings that the most talked-about giveaways in prospect are out of line with the public's priorities. Coalition Conservatives and are scrambling to claim credit for increases to the personal allowance, and Clegg identified further increases in his spring conference speech last weekend. Yet the ICM survey finds that only 16% of voters regard this as their top priority. Even less popular is an alternative income tax cut being pushed by : an increase to the £42,000 entry-point for the 40% tax bracket. Only 4% of voters picked this budget option off the menu. Even among Conservative voters, a mere 5% prioritised this option. Far more popular than either of these initiatives would be to plough extra resources into the NHS – the priority for 31% of voters – or to cut the 20% VAT rate that the coalition imposed (19%). The Lib Dems say higher allowances help the low-paid, but almost as many voters – 14% – would prefer a pause in tax credit cuts, a more targeted help for the working poor. As Osborne weighs fiscal arithmetic which some economists claim will mean that austerity, originally meant to last for only one parliament, will now have to continue through until 2020, the poll contains definite signs of voters losing patience with retrenchment. Whereas the chancellor has consistently insisted that reducing the deficit must take priority over early tax cuts, only 7% of respondents believe that if the Treasury finds itself with money to play with, the first thing to do should be repay government debt. That finding will embolden Tory backbenchers and activists, who insist that voters need to start seeing some sort of return in their pockets from all the years of austerity. The vote share of assorted minor parties in today's poll is 7%, comprising 2% each for the Scottish and Welsh nationalists, and 3% for the Green party. Surveys of voters are typically seen as popularity polls. Tuesday's Guardian/ICM survey digs into the mood of the times by probing political unpopularity. Since August, the race between Labour and the Conservatives has been pretty steady. Labour briefly bounced up after to cap energy bills at his party's conference, but other than that his lead has been remarkably consistent at three or four percentage points – the margin in six of the last eight surveys, including today's. Just over a year from a general election, the question is whether the public has simply made up its mind, or whether a great Ukip surge, a swing back to the Tories, or anything else could disrupt the equilibrium. The potential for voters to switch their loyalties is often driven by the depths of their dislikes. ICM asked voters to rate parties' likeability on a 1-7 scale, and found – unsurprisingly – that all were more disliked (indicated by an answer of 1-3) than liked (a rating of 5-7). Labour is currently the least disliked, but even its balance is negative: 40% dislike it, while 36% feel warmly towards it. For the Tories, the 49%-30% balance is much more negative. Things are worse still for the Lib Dems – disliked by 54%, liked by only 20% – and even more so for Ukip, where the ""dislikes"" enjoy a 58% to 19% edge. The 35% who dislike Ukip ""a lot"" (rating it 1) is far higher than for any other party, indicating limits to the appeal of Nigel Farage's anti-politically correct persona. Parties, and particularly parties of the right perhaps, comfort themselves that while they may be unloved, they can win support by being respected. So ICM also asked voters about whom they could imagine supporting. This approach also suggested that Labour is fishing in the biggest pond – only 37% say they ""could never vote"" for Labour, as against 45% for the Tories. In past years, the Lib Dems picked up support from all sides, but after seeing them govern in coalition, more people (56%) would automatically rule them out than the Tories. Again, however, it is the limits of Ukip's appeal that comes through most clearly of all: 59% say they could never lend Farage their support in a general election. Of course, May's European elections are another matter, but with 62% of even Tory voters saying they could never back Ukip at Westminster, it is hard to imagine it breaking the political mould. On the other hand, the Tories face grave difficulties in winning back support already lost to Ukip – 59% of Ukip voters say they could never vote for the Tories, against a mere 38% who say they would consider it. A considerably higher proportion of Lib Dems (47%) say they might be tempted into the Tory fold, and the smaller sliver of the Labour vote (25%) is more significant, both because the Labour pool of supporters is larger, and because of the way the electoral system works. All told, the poll suggests that the number of voters that the Tories might hope to snatch from Labour and the Lib Dems is roughly four times larger than the number of Ukip voters who might embrace David Cameron – which highlights the dangers for him in obsessing about his right flank at the expense of the middle ground."

1712	1713	Home rule within UK best for Scotland, says former Labour first minister 	"The former Labour first minister Jack McConnell has set out a positive case for Scottish home rule within the UK, arguing that a dislike of David Cameron is not a good enough reason to vote yes to independence. Speaking to an audience of Better Together supporters in Edinburgh on the 15th anniversary of the opening of the Scottish parliament in 1999, McConnell said the campaign had become unnecessarily polarised between nationalism and unionism. ""It doesn't reflect modern ,"" he said. ""It's time for those of us who played such a big part in creating home rule inside the UK and also making it work to come out fighting for it."" McConnell was one of the leaders of the successful yes campaign in the devolution referendum of 1997. In the speech – his first significant intervention in the independence referendum campaign – McConnell insisted that home rule was not ""a compromise, a tactic or all we can achieve"". Repeating Barack Obama's famous slogan ""yes we can"", he said Scotland was a healthier, economically stronger and more confident place after 15 years of devolution, citing the smoking ban, the growth in renewable energy and the formation of the National Theatre of Scotland. Asked whether the Scottish parliament could expect further powers from Westminster in the event of a no vote, he called for a ""conference of the new union"" to reconsider the way the UK is governed and address the centralisation of power, but said this would be unrealistic before the general election of 2015. Pro-union parties have yet to offer voters any detailed cross-party commitment to more devolution if the no campaign is successful. McConnell, who stepped back from after his time as first minister ended in 2007, said the only person who had ever broken a promise on the offer of more powers was Margaret Thatcher, and she had ""paid a price in Scotland"". The phrase ""home rule"" has become popular in recent weeks, in particular with Labour supporters of the no campaign. On the latest leg of his 100 Towns in 100 Days tour in Falkirk on Monday, the shadow secretary of state for international development, Jim Murphy, acknowledged: ""Home rule is a much more powerful phrase than devolution."" On Tuesday new polling from YouGov showed an increase in support for the no side, with 35% saying they would vote yes if the referendum were tomorrow, compared with 54% who would vote no and 12% who were either undecided or would not vote. One of a series of polls for the Times, the results showed an increase of two points in the no vote since March, and a decrease of two points for the yes side. The results for female voters, a key constituency in this referendum campaign, remained static since March with 62% in favour of remaining in the union, compared to 38% voting for independence, excluding those who are undecided. This compares with ICM polling for Scotland on Sunday which found a rise in support for independence particularly marked among female voters, previously less likely to be drawn to yes, with an increase of five percentage points since May."

381	382	The eking out of the Hobbit franchise offers poor value for fans 	"""This is one for the fans!"" screamed Quentin Tarantino in self-congratulatory mode, during a 2001 interview on the subject of his forthcoming samurai epic Kill Bill. The film was set to compensate loyal followers for years of creative inertia, so it seemed more than a little odd when he later split the movie in two at the behest of its producers. His beloved fans would now be expected to pay for two separate tickets and wait an extra six months to see Bill meet his maker, and all to ensure a larger box office take for backers Miramax Films. The reaction was far from appreciative. Fast-forward a decade and last year's announcement that The Hobbit – just 310 pages long in book form – would be stretched across three lengthy epics was met with a fan reaction verging on the priapic. So when did audiences become so deferential to a release strategy blatantly motivated by naked financial gain? The trend has grown apace since Tarantino's double Bill proved a financial godsend for Miramax, while audience resistance has dwindled to nothing. When the producers of the Harry Potter franchise split Deathly Hallows down the middle in 2010 (that's 3.5 horcruxes a film, stats fans) it still felt like a dicey manoeuvre. Three years later, a two-part conclusion is practically de rigueur, with The Hunger Games' final chapter Mockingjay set to double-team audiences across the autumns of 2014 and 2015 . Where fanboys and girls once felt hard done by such a mercenary approach to film distribution, now they actively petition studios to extend their tired franchises into oblivion . In some ways, the trend harks back to the age of cinema intermissions – short breaks in the middle of lengthy films designed to allow projectionists to change reels and audience members to stretch their legs and/or sneak into neighbouring screens. In 1969, a screening of Paint Your Wagon wasn't complete without the chance to stop halfway, have a breather and ponder whether or not Lee Marvin would manage to tame Jean Seberg's headstrong ways come the second act. The problem was that intermissions meant longer running times, which in turn meant fewer screenings per day. Why, the studios reasoned, should they give audiences three hours' entertainment for the price of one admission when they could hold half the narrative hostage for 12 months and double their money ? What we're left with is the movies' equivalent of those magazine subscriptions that promise you a die-cast Porsche but don't give you the tailpipe until week 79. The Hobbit's tailpipe will be shipped out next December, in the form of final franchise entry There And Back Again, but Tolkien obsessives need not despair. In an interview with MTV last year, director Peter Jackson (whose net worth was recently estimated at £220m) revealed that additional Middle-Earth movies would be a ""fine idea"". You know, for the fans."	Film
7871	7872	Bank of England expected to keep interest rates on hold 	"Interest rates are expected to remain on hold on Thursday as policymakers weigh up the mounting arguments for a first change in more than five years. This week's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) is the first since governor Mark Carney's warning in his annual Mansion House speech that rates could rise sooner than markets were expecting. Minutes from the last two meetings have shown that some members believe the arguments for raising rates have become more balanced as the UK economy recovers and the unemployment situation improves. Many economists predict the first rate hike will happen in November before gradual rises leave the rate in the region of 2.25% by the end of 2016. Rates have been at 0.5% since March 2009 and have not risen since 2007. This month's decision of the MPC will be announced at noon. The pound is at a near-six year high against the US dollar on forecasts of a rate rise later this year, although this momentum was jolted on Tuesday by unexpectedly weak output figures from the manufacturing sector. The Bank has also been given leeway by signs of more slack in the labour market than previously thought, following a fall in growth in average pay from 1.9% to 0.7%. Inflation has also been weaker than expected, at 1.5% in May. The expects growth of 0.9% in the second quarter, easing back to 0.7% in the third quarter following growth of 0.8% in the first three months of 2014. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""We suspect that the vote to leave the Bank rate on hold will be unanimous once again. ""And while a rate hike before the end of the year cannot be ruled out if the recovery accelerates, the likely weakness of inflation means that there is a good chance the MPC sits on its hands until early 2015."""

12941	12942	Fifty Shades Of Grey: has sex in cinema become boring? 	 see the backed-up hunger for the forthcoming , with all its palely transgressive, kiss-the-lash sexual provocations, and I ask myself, did the clock just stop? Have we moved one inch into the sexual future since 1975? Is this still all it takes – a virginal naif willing to submit, a power magnate keen to dominate more than just his supine boardroom and stunted workforce, and a fancy set of bedroom restraints – to whip America up into a tumescent frenzy of anticipation? I say 1975 advisedly because that seems like the year when Hollywood topped out on what it was prepared to show sexually in the wake of the 1968 MPAA ratings reforms. Even now, even with the NC-17 rating, Hollywood is hard-pressed to match what was sexually acceptable in mid-70s international cinema. In movies like The Damned, The Night Porter and Salon Kitty, it was the Nazis who were the big pervy freaks – cross-dressing, engaging in polymorphous perversity at the drop of a spiked helmet, and offering severed heads in pretty boxes as fond love tokens. Now it’s the lions of Silicon Valley and other slavery-friendly carnivores of the One Per Cent whose libidos only come alive at the prospect of antiseptic steel-and-glass, power-game non-sex, with no touching and no eye-contact. It’s always businessmen, isn’t it, always these buccaneering capitalist overdogs? Christian Grey, whose big chopper really is just a helicopter, Mickey Rourke’s arbitrageur in 9 ½ Weeks, Richard Gere’s corporate raider in Pretty Woman, Patrick Bateman… Does that make their womenfolk metaphors for America, ready to bend themselves into any position to seek Wall Street’s perfidious and fleeting favour? Sexual melodramas are in a double bind today – the Golden Age of Hollywood is dead, but the Golden Age of Masturbation is in full flood. You can find more transgressive and troublingly icky sex on the internet before breakfast than will pass before the MPAA ratings board in the next century (they’re even getting to “fifth base” on The Mindy Project, meaning nowadays the most offensive thing about the butter sequence in Last Tango In Paris is the saturated fats). And it’s free for all, so how does Hollywood compete? Well, it doesn’t; instead, it gives us status porn: limos, helipads, penthouse sex-eyries, gazillion thread-count percale sheets. But never the wet spot in the bed, never the broken condom. In an age of sexual oversupply, I sometimes think fondly of “when they kept their clothes on”. Dorothy Malone removing her spectacles in , Marilyn’s diaphanous dress in Some Like it Hot, Cyd Charisse whipping off her floor-length green greatcoat to reveal that provocative red dress in The Band Wagon. For now I’ll count less as much, much more.	Film
5930	5931	Construction sector optimism fades as housing market cools 	Britain’s builders enjoyed their strongest run in 17 years in the third quarter but there are signs that growth will slow as . The construction sector has grown consistently for the past year and a half, but optimism among companies plummeted in September on outlook fears. The Markit/Cips construction PMI, a closely watched early indicator of activity, averaged at 63.5 between July and September – the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 1997, when the survey began. A reading above 50 indicates growth. In September, the pace of growth in the sector continued to accelerate, with the index hitting an eight-month high of 64.2, up from 64 in August. It was better than the 63.5 forecast by City economists, and painted . Chris Williamson, chief Markit economist, said the data provided “more encouraging news on the health of the UK economy”. He added: “Although [construction] only represents around 6-7% of GDP, the sheer pace of expansion signalled by the PMI suggests that the construction sector can provide a meaningful boost to economic growth in the third quarter.” All elements of the sector showed strong growth last month: housebuilding continued to grow at the fastest pace, followed by commercial property construction and civil engineering. Despite the growth, the PMI showed signs that the strongest rates of expansion could be behind us. The pace of growth in housebuilding has slowed for the past two months and optimism among builders is fading, with the “business expectations” measure of the PMI falling to an 11-month low. The construction PMI follows a string of data in recent days that suggests the heat is coming out of the housing market. on Nationwide’s measure fell for the first time in 17 months in September, down 0.2% at £188,374. Nationwide’s figures came 24 hours after Bank of England data showed that mortgage lending had slipped for the second successive month in August. Williamson said: “Construction firms’ optimism in relation to the outlook fell to the lowest for nearly a year in September, sullied by concerns over a slowing housing market, shortages of both skilled labour and suitable subcontractors, higher interest rates and a general weakening of growth in the wider economy.” He said the could be the peak. The first official estimate of growth in the third quarter will be published by the Office for National Statistics on 24 October. Rob Wood, economist at the German bank Berenberg, also expected a weaker spell for the economy. He said: “While there is nothing to really worry about yet, we are cautious about growth over the next six months. Eurozone growth has disappointed, geopolitical risks have risen this year, the forthcoming general election creates domestic political risks, and the majority of the public expect rate hikes within the next 12 months. All of those could cause UK growth to ease a little in the near term.”	Business
11472	11473	David Cameron calls for united front from coalition 	" has called on the coalition to provide a ""strong, decisive and united government"" in the wake of acrimonious splits over Lords reform, warning that the public will not stand for ""division and navel-gazing"" at a time of social and economic insecurity. Writing in the , the prime minister acknowledged there were ""profound areas of disagreement"" between the Liberal Democrats and members of the Conservative party, 91 of whom rebelled last week against a reform package for the upper house championed by Nick Clegg. But he said MPs should remind themselves that such disagreements could not be allowed to stop the coalition working together. ""Of course the two parties have their differences and (in common with all recent governments) we have so far failed to resolve the issue of House of Lords reform,"" wrote Cameron. ""What's far more significant is that we are working together on so much else – and after last week, it's vital that everyone reminds themselves of that fact."" He added: ""These differences matter and at the next election they will help define us. But we're not in an election, now. We're not even close. People see riots and financial instability across Europe on the television news. They will tolerate tough choices if they see that you stand up for the right things together. But they will not tolerate division and navel-gazing. ""They know that the problems are big and they do not want to see politicians fall out in the process of dealing with them. That is why we must rise to the challenge, recognise the extraordinary and challenging nature of the times we live in – and serve the national interest by delivering a strong, decisive and united government."" Despite Cameron's appeal for unity, there remains pressure from the Tory backbenches for the PM to take a tougher line on his junior coalition partners. Liam Fox, the former defence secretary who resigned in October over links with his friend Adam Werritty, has the Liberal Democrats as a ""particular problem"" for the Conservatives. ""It's not sensible for people to make threats,"" he told the Sunday Telegraph. ""They have to remember they are a sixth of the coalition, not half the coalition."" He added: ""I think a lot of still deeply resent the fact we didn't win the general election and there is always a price for not winning. The price is that we have to live within a coalition and it's not a forced marriage, but it's a marriage of convenience."" Fox, a vociferous Eurosceptic, said Britain should try to renegotiate its position in Europe, saying its goal should be ""as loose a union as we can possibly get"". In a sign that Cameron is willing to give ground to Tory MPs who want to see their leader wield more clout in the coalition, the PM highlighted some of the areas where he differs markedly from the . He wrote: ""On Europe, for instance, we British need a fresh settlement – and a fresh mandate. Work on that can begin now but it is an issue to deal with in the next parliament, under a majority Conservative government. I take a profoundly different view from most Liberal Democrats on the European convention on human rights, too. I want to do whatever it takes to keep our country safe, restoring the ability to deport dangerous criminals and terrorists even if it means radical action in this area. And as I set out in a speech on welfare the other day, the next Conservative government must do more to end the benefits culture."""	Politics
11691	11692	England 1-3 Italy 	It has become a horribly familiar pattern: domination in qualifying, expectation in the build up and elimination at the finals. For the third time in succession England bowed out of the European Under-21 Championships at the group stage after slumping to a hugely-disappointing defeat to in Olomouc. Gareth Southgate had hoped his side’s in their second group game would liberate his players but here they were clinically dispatched by opponents who they have now failed to beat in five meetings at this tournament. In truth, the result was never in doubt after Andrea Belotti and Marco Benassi had put Italy two goals to the good in the space of two minutes midway through the first half. Benassi’s second with just under 20 minutes to go simply killed the potential for drama despite Nathan Redmond’s late consolation. Positive thinking had been prevalent in the camp throughout but this result left little scope for optimism. “We can’t put this group of young players in with everything else that has happened in England’s football history,” said Southgate. “These are young players and there’s some improvement that needs to happen in terms of their general defending as a group and as individuals. That’s the age they’re at. All teams in this competition have made defensive errors, sometimes they’re punished, sometimes they’re not. We’ve been punished ruthlessly for them.” Sweden’s 89th-minute equaliser against Portugal in the other Group B game meant that both sides here are heading home before the semi-finals. But while Italy went out on a high, this was certainly the lowest point of Southgate’s two-year tenure with the under-21s. The former Middlesbrough manager signed an extension to his contract with the Football Association in January and is scheduled to take the team through to the end of the 2017 edition of this competition. “I’m contracted to stay on, I’d like to stay on. In the end, it’s not my decision,” he said. “But I think what we’ve done over two years has progressed the profile of the team, the style in which we’ve played. I think we’ve had some massive success stories in terms of individuals that have come through the programme. Even in this tournament one or two players that have come through have emerged from it. So I think people will look at all of that when they’re making that decision.” Southgate had been bold with his team selection, playing Danny Ings in the No10 role behind Harry Kane and giving Brighton’s Jake Forster-Caskey a surprise first appearance of the tournament. He was rewarded with the brightest opening his side has made in the competition, with Ings pulling a shot wide when clean through and Kane, a cut above his team-mates here after enduring a largely frustrating tournament, drawing a spectacular save from Francesco Bardi in the Italy goal. Two minutes after that effort, though, events began to unravel for Southgate and his side. With England caught cold from an Italian free-kick, the impressive Domenico Berardi dinked the ball over the defensive line to find Belotti, whose telescopic volley beat Jack Butland from close range. Almost immediately the Azzurrini doubled the lead, with Lorenzo Crisetig allowed to rumble forward unchallenged and Benassi seeing his deflected shot curl low past the helpless goalkeeper. That left England with a huge task and though they set about it with relish, Italy drew the sting expertly. Even so Redmond, enjoying perhaps his best game of the tournament, Kane, Jesse Lingard and Ings all went close but any lingering hope was extinguished with 18 minutes to go. Stefano Sabelli took a throw-in, Marcello Trotta – probably best known in England for a promotion-costing penalty miss while on loan on Brentford in 2013 – hooked the ball over his head and Benassi directed his header past Butland, condemning England to yet another early exit. Redmond did eventually thrash home a goal that England’s energy deserved from the edge of the area in injury time but for Italy there were two more important late goals in the other group game between Sweden and Portugal. The first, for the Portuguese, looked to be sending them into the semi-finals. The second, an equaliser from Sweden’s Simon Tibbling, meant neither side in Olomouc will be playing in the final four. “There’s so little between the teams in this tournament,” said Southgate. “Sweden have gone through, Italy haven’t. There’s nothing between the eight teams in my opinion. So it then comes down to detail and concentration and the two-minute spell in the first half when we concede two is the turning point of the game.” It meant a bleak scene for all concerned at the Andruv Stadium – even the Czech fans in the crowd went home disappointed, with England’s defeat costing their side an Olympic play-off – but Southgate tried to sound a note of positivity. “In general terms, in terms of what they can give to English football, I think there are some good characters that are going to come through this group who will go into the senior team and make that senior team stronger.”	Football
14956	14957	Raheem Sterling to ask for Liverpool exit with Manchester City on alert 	 is expected to inform Liverpool this week that he wishes to leave the club, with Manchester City ready to test Anfield’s resolve that the England international will not be sold. The 20-year-old has put City – and other clubs – on alert that he will agitate for a move from after requesting fresh talks on his future with Anfield officials before the end of the Premier League season on Sunday. He had previously informed Brendan Rodgers that negotiations over a new contract would be postponed until the end of the season in order to concentrate solely on his football. However, the forward and his representative, Aidy Ward, are expected to tell Liverpool’s manager and the chief executive, Ian Ayre, on Friday that he will not sign a new deal with the club and wishes to move on. Sterling is said to be unhappy both at negative headlines surrounding his contract dispute with Liverpool and the absence of Champions League football at Anfield next season following the team’s miserable end to this one. Rodgers’ team have collected only eight points from the last 24 available to miss out on a top-four finish and were also eliminated from the FA Cup after a woeful display against Aston Villa in the semi-final. Liverpool could argue that Sterling’s form has dipped markedly since controversy erupted over his rejection of a new five-year contract worth £100,000-a-week and that it was his interview with the BBC, in which he denied being a “money-grabber” and said his ambition was to win trophies at the highest level, that generated the adverse publicity. Sterling, who has been linked with City and Arsenal in recent months, has already indicated to Rodgers that he wants to leave Liverpool and the latest round of talks could clarify his determination to see out his current contract, which has two years to run, should the club refuse to consider offers this summer. “The story has been blown somewhat out of proportion. Raheem and his representatives have a meeting scheduled with Liverpool later this week, and we will take proceedings from there.” Liverpool have been in discussions over a new deal since October but remain at deadlock over an agreement and their failure to secure a top-four finish represents a major setback to their hopes of convincing Sterling to stay. Liverpool do have him on a £35,000-a-week contract until 2017 and Rodgers has made it clear that he and the club’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, are minded not to sell even in the event of the impasse continuing beyond this summer. The Liverpool manager said recently: “Raheem won’t be going anywhere this summer, even if there’s not a deal agreed.” That stance has not altered since Sterling’s agent requested fresh talks ahead of the season’s finale at Stoke City on Sunday. Rodgers and FSG, however, are likely to receive confirmation in the coming days that Sterling has no intention of committing his future to Liverpool and City, who are keen to recruit young British talent this summer, will be favourites to capitalise on the continued deterioration in relations. A bid in excess of £30m may prompt Liverpool to reconsider their position on a player who should he leave in 2017 would attract only a compensation fee having been at Anfield since the age of 15. Only last week Steven Gerrard appealed to Sterling to sign a new contract. The departing captain said: “He should sign a new deal here. Brendan is a fantastic man-manager and puts a lot of time and effort into the development of an individual. The danger for these young players is they want it all too soon and they go chasing it. Then they go to another club and just become a number.” But Gerrard’s request appears almost certain to be ignored.	Football

He was eventually replaced in the 31st minute after slumping to the ground with suspected concussion. Germany went on to beat Argentina 1-0 in extra time to lift the trophy. Kramer’s continuation in the game, after suffering an apparent concussion, , as there were worrying head injuries for several other players earlier in the tournament. The Argentina players Javier Mascherano and Pablo Zabaleta also played on in their team’s after hard knocks to the head. The Uruguay defender Álvaro Pereira refused to leave the field after being hit in the head during the group stage. The incidents have led to debate over whether Fifa should allow a temporary substitution so a player can have a head injury properly checked.	Football
7499	7500	Caroline Flint tipped to run as Labour's deputy leader against Tom Watson 	 is extremely likely to run as deputy leader of the Labour party in a challenge to the likely trade union favourite Tom Watson, the Guardian understands. Flint, who was shadow energy secretary under Ed Miliband, will probably not declare until the timetable for the process is set out after a national executive committee meeting on Tuesday. However, sources close to the Yorkshire MP said she was almost certain to throw her hat into the ring. Watson is the only candidate for deputy at the moment and launched a crowdfunding attempt on Sunday to . The race to be deputy looks set to be an even starker clash between the Brownites and Blairites within the party than the race for the leadership. Watson, who campaigned against phone hacking, is deeply involved in the trade union movement and the old wing of the party. In contrast, Flint’s politics are closer to those of Blairites Chuka Umunna and Liz Kendall than those of the other potential leadership candidates Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. Gloria De Piero, Miliband’s shadow equalities minister and a former GMTV presenter, is also a strong contender to be deputy leader, possibly on a ticket with Tristram Hunt as leader. Another possible choice for the deputy leadership is Angela Eagle, who was shadow leader of the House of Commons and delivered impressive performances in parliament against her Tory adversary, William Hague. The slate of potential deputies will be crucial to those running for leader as they seek to shape the future of the party in the aftermath of a crushing defeat at the hands of David Cameron. There may be some pressure in the Labour party to choose a woman as the next leader, but having strong female deputy leadership candidates could address this. Flint was often sent out to promote Labour’s campaign in the media, especially after the television debates, and trebled her majority in Don Valley at the election. It is understood she feels Labour needs to win back working- and middle-class voters in the south of England but wants the party to take time to reflect on what went wrong.	Politics

It will be the first time Green has appeared since and since t used to help customers evade tax. Green was chief executive and then chairman of HSBC from 2003 to 2010, the period covered by the leak of customer data about the banking arm, showing how it turned a blind eye to illegal activities of arms dealers and helped wealthy people evade taxes. The so-called files, which cover the period 2005-2007, amounted to the biggest banking data leak in history, shedding light on around 30,000 accounts holding almost $120bn (£78bn) in assets. The economic affairs committee, chaired by Clive Hollick, a Labour peer who used to run United Business Media, intends to ask Green about the Swiss operation and HSBC’s Mexican business, which was hit by . Imposing the fine, US regulators pointed to a “blatant failure” to implement anti-money-laundering controls in the bank’s Mexican operation that allowed local drug traffickers to deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars each day in HSBC accounts. Hollick’s committee will also ask whether global banks are too large to manage and whether the policy of US prosecutors to issue multimillion-pound fines against companies, rather than prosecute individuals, is the right approach to improve the ethics and culture of banks. Green will give evidence alongside Sir Win Bischoff, the veteran banker who is a former chairman of Lloyds Group. Bischoff is currently chairman of the Financial Reporting Council. Green and Bischoff will also be asked about the bonus culture in the City of London.	Business

Having paid out $3bn to music rights holders so far, is pitching itself as a competitor to traditional broadcasting, having recently added news, weather, podcasts and videos to its service. “The old-world paradigms we used to have are no longer true. When I think about music in the future, I don’t make a distinction between what’s radio, what used to be the music library, and so on,” Ek told the in a rare interview. “It’s only going to be listening – and, as that goes forward, this old notion of these different industries or different competitors will collapse and merge together.” Spotify is stepping up its efforts to appeal to mainstream radio listeners by emphasising its collection of playlists “programmed” by an in-house editorial team and suggested to users based on the time of day, popular activities and their listening habits. “We’re getting better and better at giving upcoming artists exposure on the service and creating tools to give those new artists a way to market themselves. In the future, people will listen to more music from a bigger variety of artists,” said Ek. “And if we build the revenue model around ‘freemium’ [a business model that gives basic products away for free], the music industry will be much larger than it’s ever been before, more artists will be able to make a living by being artists and more people will listen in turn.” Spotify will have to win over its doubters first, including convincing them that it can turn more of its 45 million free users into paying subscribers – it has 15 million of the latter – and thus increase the money earned by artists and songwriters, via its payouts to the labels and publishers that represent them. Some artists, most famously , have been criticising Spotify’s “freemium” approach, which allows people to listen for free to its basic, advertising-supported service. The boss of the world’s largest music label, Universal Music, called free streaming “not something that is particularly sustainable in the long term”. With industry rumours of Apple egging major labels on to restrict Spotify’s free service, Spotify is feeling the heat. “It’s no secret there’s been a lot of debate,” said Ek. “In any industry which is in a massive transition, those kinds of debates occur, so I don’t think it’s surprising. And suppliers always want to get paid more, which is also not very surprising.” Ek added that Spotify is “aligned with the industry” on its desire for more subscribers, but returned to the idea of Spotify as the new radio – traditionally a free, ad-supported medium – to stand his ground. “The entire recorded music industry has somewhere between $14bn and $15bn in trade-sales value. Now look at the radio industry, which in the US alone is around $16bn in revenue and globally is about $80bn – four times the size of the music industry,” said Ek. “If we’re able to transition the traditional radio behaviour online, you’re looking at a music industry that’s much larger than it’s ever been. If you do that, and also add subscription to the mix, especially at Spotify’s conversion rate, you’d be looking at a music industry that would be $100bn to $160bn in size. That’s the key argument that I think gets lost here.” Spotify is far from the only company pursuing this aim. Deezer, Rhapsody, Tidal, SoundCloud and other streaming services are jockeying for attention, although it is technology giants Apple and Google that are more likely to be Spotify’s nemeses. On Monday, Apple is expected to unveil its new rival to Spotify, with hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users to market to, and deep pockets to secure exclusive music from popular musicians. Google has one service already live under its Google Play brand, and another in testing. Ek claimed that Spotify’s music focus will be its trump card. “We don’t really do anything else other than selling music, so we’re the most aligned with the music industry,” he said. “We don’t have the search box that we’re making money from, or the hardware that we’re making money from.” The downside to this is resources: Spotify reported revenues of €1bn in 2014, compared with Apple’s $199.7bn and Google’s $66bn. The costs of running a streaming music service – Spotify reported a loss of €165m in 2014 – are a drop in the ocean for hardware and search-engine businesses. “Yes, obviously it’s easier if they want to absorb the costs into other places. But we believe in the business model of Spotify, and believe that ultimately we’ll become profitable at some point,” said Ek. “If we think there’s 10x potential yet to be unlocked, why wouldn’t we invest in that growth rather than optimise for short-term profitability? We think this is a huge opportunity.”	Technology
6405	6406	Jack Reacher film gives New Zealand viewer too little bang for his buck 	"A seen in a trailer for recent Tom Cruise thriller did not make the final cut is to get his money back. The man, identified only as J Congdon, complained to New Zealand's Advertising Standards Authority after realising the tantalising shot had been removed from the theatrical release by Hollywood studio Paramount. ""The explosion where the whole cliff comes down was the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie … aside from having in it,"" he wrote in his letter of complaint. Paramount said it was happy to refund the cost of a ticket but pointed out that it was standard practice for Hollywood to release trailers cut ""weeks or months"" in advance of the final movie. ""Thus, despite our best intentions, it is always possible that certain scenes appearing in an advertisement or trailer may not appear in the final version of a film,"" the studio told the authority. ""The explosion in question was a single split-second element omitted from a 130-minute long action film."" The studio said at least two other shots in the trailer had not made the final cut. New Zealand's Commercial Approvals Bureau, which approved the trailer, said it believed the complaint should be dismissed because the promo posed ""no threat of confusion to the large majority of TV viewers"". The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the matter settled because a ticket refund had been offered and the offending advertisement was no longer airing."	Film
2057	2058	Divergent review – lacks lustre and grit 	A somewhat lacklustre contender for the throne, this latest slice of dystopian young-adult entertainment is based on a runaway bestseller penned by while still an undergraduate. The hokey setup finds a futuristic, postwar society in which the now pacified population are divided into five distinct groups, each with their own singular attributes: Abnegation (selfless); Amity (peaceful); Candor (honest); Dauntless (brave); and Erudite (intelligent). No, I didn't buy it either, but never mind because neither does heroine Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) who commits the unspeakable crime of having more than one skill, thus making her… Divergent! Rising star Woodley (who picked up a Golden Globe nomination playing George Clooney's daughter in ) gives it some welly in the lead role, more than holding her own again Kate Winslet's sinister uber-matriarch Jeanine, but Tris is no Katniss Everdeen, at least not yet – inevitably, this is the first instalment in a trilogy, with and to follow. Drab production design (bombed-out buildings and costumes) aims for gloomy portent, but the grit feels as fake as the fashionable tattoos.	Film
14934	14935	Petr Cech will decide on his Chelsea future in the summer 	Petr Cech has no intention of remaining as Chelsea’s second-choice goalkeeper and will make a decision on his future this summer. After a decade as Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, the 32-year-old Czech Republic international has been displaced as No1 by Thibaut Courtois this season. Cech has made four Premier League starts to Courtois’ 25 this term, but did play in the earlier this month in what could be interpreted as a show of thanks from manager José Mourinho. “I don’t know what the club’s idea will be,” Cech told the website of Czech newspaper Idnes. “It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo. But that can work for one season only. I don’t want another one like this. “There always will be speculation. I leave it for the summer. It will be important to sit down with the club and with the manager to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.” Cech has been linked with clubs such as Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal. Mourinho earlier this month insisted he would not stand in Cech’s way should he wish to leave at the end of the season. But Cech’s status means a big fee will be required to prise him from Stamford Bridge as his contract does not expire until the end of next season. “I don’t waste my time trying to persuade him, because I know nobody can persuade him,” Mourinho said. “If he tells me he wants to leave, I will tell him my opinion and my opinion is one of the three best goalkeepers in the world. Huge money.”	Football

13022	13023	Emma Brockes meets Clint Eastwood, one of the last American heroes, to talk about films, politics and ageing 	"eople who have worked with invariably talk about the first time he rang and the effect of his creaky, whispery voice on their nervous system. In a studio on the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, California, his arrival is counted down in paces between the coffee urn and the biscuit tray, while outside people queue for a chatshow next door and executives glide to lunch in their golf buggies. Eastwood enters with an awkward, loping gait, as from another era. He has made films of every stripe in the past 10 years, but for most of us he will always be that man: who starts a fight in a saloon, who defends a lady's honour, who, now that Paul Newman is gone, is one of the last American heroes. Or, as he puts it with conscientious self-mockery and a flash of his green, green eyes, ""the jerk from the plains"". Longevity in Hollywood can inspire embarrassing devotion and Eastwood, heading towards 80, finds much of what comes his way unseemly. Men have a hard time comporting themselves in his presence; women make regrettable observations about his green eyes. The myth is so established, one forgets that in the 60s and early 70s, he made a lot of schlocky, forgettable westerns as well as classics such as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. The cowboy, marshal or gunslinger whose idea of showing emotion is to shift a cigar from one side of his mouth to the other is a heroic type we are supposed to have outgrown. And yet the glamour persists, entwined as it is with ideas of what it is to be American and a nostalgia, perhaps, for less officious eras. Eastwood didn't say much in those films, but what he did say - ""You didn't hear the lady, did you, boy?"", ""Cool it, cowboy"", ""Next time I'll knock your damn head off"" - compacted over time into legend. Even the most banal line - ""Put your pants on, chief"" - was transformed by Eastwood's growl into something sounding like wisdom. Today he settles in his director's chair with the cool, polite detachment he reserves, one imagines, for outlaws and journalists. There are spots of high colour on his cheeks that make him look, oddly, rather vulnerable and take the menace out of his pointy incisors. Eastwood's tough-guy image was always leavened by something soft at the edges, the beauty spot above his lip, the fact that he was, throughout the 60s, very obviously a man who got as much use out of his hairdryer as Warren Beatty. He worked hard to break the mould of that early career in a way he now jokes about. Eastwood is about to cast for a film about Nelson Mandela, adapted from John Carlin's book, and when I ask who will play him, he looks devilish and says, ""I'm going to play him. I'm going to show you my versatility."" (It will actually be Morgan Freeman. ""Perfect casting for Mandela."") One way or another, Eastwood's interests always seem to come back to the issue of heroism, particularly to the unsympathetic hero. In his new film, Gran Torino, he plays Walt Kowalski, a trigger-happy, cantankerous old bigot (imagine if Henry Fonda in On Golden Pond had been armed) who learns over time to love his Hmong neighbours more than his petulant family and to make a great sacrifice for them. It sounds corny, but it's a better film than Million Dollar Baby, the sentimental Oscar-winner he directed in 2004 and in which he played a similar role. Once Eastwood stops snarling and overacting - a pitfall of directing oneself - he turns in a touching performance and the film is funny and moving and unexpectedly shocking. Did he want to play Walt from the off? ""Yeah."" Yeah? ""Yeah."" Right. Eventually, he continues: ""Yeah, I liked the dilemmas he had to go through. I liked the message of antique America that is maybe obsolete. Walt may be obsolete."" He laughs gently. ""But he does learn new things. And that's what makes it interesting. You take a guy who's way out opinionated, insulting to equal opportunity"" - this sounds like a phrase he's had to adjust to - ""an insulter, and you put him with people where he's antagonistic as hell. And then all of a sudden he looks in the mirror and says, 'I have more in common with these people than my own spoilt, rotten family.' He's realising these folks like having him around, even though he's not particularly on the surface likable."" The film nervously calibrates Walt's bigotry by going overboard with examples of affectionate racial mockery between Irish, Italians and Poles to show that, you know, there are levels to these things. I ask whether he was anxious about getting this tone right. ""I wasn't anxious about anything. I figure one thing when you get to my age is, what can they do to ya?"" Likewise, he bats away being overlooked at the Oscars. Gran Torino was number one at the US box office but didn't get a single nomination. ""I have had three films nominated out of the last five I've made. I just make the film the best I can. The rest is political stuff and posturing. I'm not terribly good at that. I think our message was as good as any message out there this year. There we are."" At some point, the reticence of Dirty Harry and Joe Kidd turned into the old-age misanthropy of Walt Kowalski and Frankie Dunn, and when, in 2000, Eastwood made Space Cowboys with Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland, the joke was it should have been called Grumpy Old Astronauts. At 78, he is still wiry and tough looking, but his posture is bad and his famous whisper sounds, occasionally, like the frailty of age. ""Eighty is just a number,"" he says. ""A lot of people are old at 40."" No twinges of vanity when he sees himself on screen? ""It's too late for vanity. If I was 30, maybe, I'd say, 'Hey, that's not a good angle.' But there is no good angle now. So you just kinda accept it and go ahead."" Eastwood is kept young, perhaps, by his family; he has seven children who range in age from 12 to their early 40s. The 12-year-old daughter, Morgan, lives with him and his second wife, Dina Ruiz, a former TV anchorwoman from Arizona. He married his first wife, Maggie Johnson, when he was 21 and had two children with her. They didn't divorce for 30 years, during which time he had a child with Roxanne Tunis, two with Jacelyn Reeves and one with Frances Fisher, while conducting a long relationship with the actor Sondra Locke. I wonder if Morgan thinks he's cool or embarrassing. Eastwood looks surprised. ""I think she thinks I'm a cool dad. We get along very well. I have a teenage daughter as well. And I think they think I'm all right. I'm not totally objective. I don't think they think of me as a guy who should be their grandfather. I used to joke about it: that my kids didn't give me any grand- children, so I just had my own grandchildren."" One imagines that being the son of Clint Eastwood throws up very particular problems, as being the daughter of some icon of femininity might for a girl. I ask if his sons have had a tougher time of it than his daughters. ""Maybe. Maybe not. I don't think so."" He pauses. ""Maybe."" Another long pause. ""I don't think they need to get screwed up. The parents have to keep instilling in them the logic of life. Not everyone becomes a known figure. There's disadvantages to it and there's advantages to it. Don't try to make it any more than it is."" This isn't, of course, something he can entirely control, the way his fame affects his children. ""You're never in total control. But you have to have ambitions to set the agenda and fate does the rest."" Control is a big thing for Eastwood, whose ""logic of life"" is deeply entwined with his Libertarian politics, which he brings up with a wry smile, taking into account that most people think Libertarianism is at best unrealistic and at worst crackpot. He registered as a Republican in 1951 in support of Eisenhower, whom he admired for his second world war heroism and election promise to end the war in Korea. Eastwood's short tenure as mayor of Carmel, the town south of San Francisco where he lives, was premised, he told the New Yorker, on ""doing things for people who can't stand up for themselves"". Since then, he says, the Republican party has lost its way - he was not in favour of going to war in Iraq, and the evangelical side of the party annoys him. ""The only thing John McCain and I really agreed upon was that the Republicans had lost their way because they lost their philosophy."" The core of that philosophy, he says, is that ""people should be responsible for themselves and fiscal responsibility is very, very important."" He says of the current economic crisis: ""The great saying that if you don't pay attention to history you're doomed to repeat it is pretty much true. Pretty much true. Now we're repeating it. You get what you deserve."" For the election, his wife registered as an independent, although, he says, they both thought, ""Obama seemed like a nice guy."" And Eastwood? ""I registered,"" he smiles, ""Libertarian. I like the philosophies. The Libertarian party is nothing and they don't have any candidates. But I do believe if we just leave everybody alone, quit trying to think of ways to run everybody else's life, maybe we'd be better off. It may be impractical. It may be obsolete, that kind of thinking."" He looks off into the distance: ""It's just kinda the way I was raised."" Eastwood's long-term vision about his career was unusual both in its accuracy and the tenacity with which he pursued it. In his early 30s, he could see that if he carried on making westerns they would get worse and he would eventually fall out of fashion. The way to save himself was to diversify. He is a pianist and has written the scores for many of his films, but it was to directing that he turned. He had campaigned to direct episodes of Rawhide, the TV series that started his career; the studio refused, but finally, in 1971, he was given Play Misty For Me, a low-budget film about a woman stalking a local radio star. Misty is still a tense, well-managed thriller today, although there is a self-indulgent bit where the character played by Eastwood and his girlfriend frolic on a beach, in a wood and under a waterfall, that would presage overlong sequences in many of his films. Directing, he says, is the greater joy. ""You're the storyteller. As an actor you're just involved with the one component, your component. And your relationship to the ensemble. I prefer directing. I have to. I'm at the age where I should. So."" Eastwood is not a shouter on set; his is a quiet authority. Apart from Spike Lee, no one in the industry seems to have a bad word for him. He is said to be gentlemanly to a fault, professional, deeply engaged. He is also disinclined to censor himself. It is customary when making a film based on a novel not to bad-mouth the source material. In 1995 he made The Bridges Of Madison County, one of the directing roles that, with Unforgiven, raised his profile as a serious director; he called Robert James Waller's novel ""fancy, pretentious writing"" that he had ""fought"" to get through. His tiff with Spike Lee last year followed Lee's accusations that Eastwood did not include any black soldiers in his second world war film Flags Of Our Fathers, the story of the men who raised the US flag after the battle of Iwo Jima. It is a bleak, beautiful film that seems to go on for several days and, amid all the battle scenes, exploits what Eastwood has always done best: stillness. He replied that Lee should ""shut his face"" - the film was historically accurate. Now he says, ""It wasn't really a tiff. I was in Cannes and somebody said that he was quoted saying this and that. Some journalist. And I said, well if he said that... and I shot my mouth off. But he's a nice guy. I think Spike was just trying to promote his flick. I understand the game."" He grins. ""I just thought I wasn't going to let him off the hook."" He won't speculate on how he has influenced cinema, or who he considers to be the heirs to Dirty Harry or Josey Wales. Jason Bourne, perhaps, although he gets too weepy over his dead girlfriend. Eastwood never betrayed an interior life beyond the hint of a secret sadness. He never fell for the posse mentality, and even when he was playing a cop, he was as suspicious of the law as of the outlaws - in Hang 'Em High, a judge admonishes his Marshal Jedediah Cooper: ""You can be the best I've ever had, the best there is, if you remember this: you work for the government. You work for justice."" His characters didn't work for anyone, of course, which is why we'll always love them. For his own inspiration, he says, he looked to John Wayne and Gary Cooper, ""old-time movie actors. I was influenced by James Cagney a lot. I liked his inner vitality. And he was fearless. Not afraid to do crazy things, take a grapefruit in the face. I've always felt that suited me as well."" What is that, not being afraid to fail? ""I think it's just... not being afraid."" He quotes FDR - ""The only thing to fear is fear itself"" - then repeats it in a silly voice, to show he isn't that pompous. ""Anyway, it was like that mentality. Yeah, I'll just barge in, make that commitment, go for it, otherwise you miss great opportunities to enjoy yourself and have fun and create characters that are interesting. Sometimes you have to swing hard and miss the ball. But you have to swing hard."" Given his fame, Eastwood has an unusually sensible attitude. He hasn't burned out, or become an addict, or cast himself against women half his age. There's no great mystery to it, he says. ""Just stacking up information. Not forgetting it."" He drops his voice even lower than his usual whisper and leans in. ""Not forgetting."" His eyes really are very green. Gran Torino is released on Friday. This article was amended on Monday 23 February 2009. We originally said that Clint Eastwood plays a ""cantankerous old bigot ... who learns to love his Korean neighbours"". The neighbours are Hmong, not Korean. This has been corrected."	Film
9386	9387	BFI heralds billion-pound year for British film 	"The British Film Institute heralded a billion-pound UK film industry today, publishing figures that show that investment from overseas sources in film production in the UK rose by 14% to £1.075bn for 2013. The rise was spurred on by 37 major international productions basing themselves in the UK, with everything from forthcoming Marvel blockbuster to starry dramas like being at least partially made on these shores. Two of the most surefire hits of the coming years, in the next movie and , are also set to be made in the UK. It's a trend that the UK government is trying to promote via its to the rules regarding tax breaks for the film industry: films only need to now spend 10% of their budget within the UK to qualify for tax relief, where previously they had to spend 25%. George Osborne acknowledged as much, saying: ""These fast growing sectors are creating jobs across the country and each new job means security for another family. I want to build on this success and showcase the world class talent this country has, encouraging more films and TV programmes to be made here."" The latest tack is to woo China and its massive audiences, with struck recently that allows Sino-British productions to bypass the quota system in China that only allows a certain number of international films to be screened there. Homegrown productions were spending less money however, with just £139m spent on British-produced films costing over £500,000, compared with £229m in 2012. The courting of international productions comes as of British films were found to be profitable between 2003 and 2010, and independent UK films made up only 6% of the total UK box office last year. The Working Title-produced musical was named as the top grossing UK film at the UK box-office, with £41m. Those box office takings were over £1bn for the third year in a row, but actually faltered slightly, falling by 1% – but 2012 was buoyed by , the highest-grossing film ever in the UK. Animation continues to be a massive draw for UK audiences, with the highest-grossing film of 2013, and Frozen, Monsters University and The Croods all in the top 10; the top five also included The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Les Miserables and Iron Man 3. The big independent UK films last year were topped by , which took £11m, followed by Quartet, I Give It a Year, and Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa."	Film
13258	13259	World Cup 2014: ‘Very cool’ Marouane Fellaini praised by Belgium players 	Belgium’s players have paid tribute to Marouane Fellaini for coming to their rescue in their opening World Cup match, suggesting that his national side know how to use him better than . Fellaini has endured a miserable time since moving to Old Trafford last summer in a £27.5m deal but equalised for Belgium in their just five minutes after coming off the bench in the second half. Jan Vertonghen, the Tottenham Hotspur defender who gave away the first-half penalty that handed Algeria the lead, said Fellaini was “very important” to the national side. “I know there has been a lot of pressure on him from the fans in England but in he always does well and scores goals,” said Vertonghen. “I’m very pleased for him and I gave him a little hug after the game because I know that goal meant a lot to him. “Marouane is a very cool guy. The pressure doesn’t really bother him too much. We know how to use him and I don’t know whether they do in his other team.” Belgium’s captain Vincent Kompany said Fellaini’s qualities had always been apparent in a national shirt. “Fellaini is a terrific player and any player in his first season at a new club, it can be tough. You have to grant players a couple of seasons before you can judge someone. For us, with Belgium, he has been doing it time and time again. Players like Dries Mertens as well are our weapons coming off the bench.” Fellaini, who was the only major incoming transfer at Old Trafford last summer but faces an uncertain future under United’s new manager Louis van Gaal, said that Belgium’s substitutes had made a “big impact” on the game. Marc Wilmots introduced Mertens, who scored the winner, at half-time and Fellaini 20 minutes into the second half. “Everyone knows we have good players, we have a good team, but for the first 30 minutes, we were just so nervous, there was too much stress. I think that is normal for the first together but in the second half we showed the character of Belgium and we played very well,” he said. “It was a great goal, it was great for me and for the team. It’s not been the best season for me but football is like this. It is a boost for the confidence of the Belgian team. Algeria made it so tough, but we showed our character and ability.” The highly fancied Belgians, who struggled in the first half against a well organised Algeria side, face Fabio Capello’s Russia in their second game on Sunday. Kompany admitted nerves played a part in their unconvincing first-half display against Algeria. “It was the very, very first minutes of any World Cup ever for this generation of Belgian players, all of the players except for Daniel Van Buyten have never been at a World Cup,” he said, admitting that the pressure to perform had an effect. “Of course for those first 15 minutes, however much experience you have in wider football – I remember even Lionel Messi saying how he had felt the pressure when he first played at a World Cup – so how is it possible for us not to feel it?” But he said he was proud of his teammates for not panicking when they went behind and for slowly working their way back into the game. “It means a lot that we overcame a difficult start but as much as it means, we remain calm for the rest of the campaign as well, we know it will be tough against Russia. The biggest mistake we can do is underestimate these teams. Hopefully we’ll do our job and we can qualify and like any team, grow in this tournament. “After 15 or 20 minutes we got control of the game and then conceded at that moment. We never panicked, we stayed calm. We actually had these kind of scenarios quite often in the qualifiers as well, so that helps.” Romelu Lukaku, who struggled in the first half and was withdrawn after an hour, said the team was not dynamic enough in the first period. “We played too slowly in possession in the first half, it was not dynamic enough but in the second half, it was much quicker, we got more crosses in the box and we scored from one,” said the Chelsea striker, who spent last season on loan at Everton. “It has been so long for us to wait to play at a World Cup and we have a young team as well so we had difficulties in the first hour of the game but then we took it into our hands like a big team should do.” Lukaku predicted Belgium would learn from the experience and improve as the tournament progressed. “We showed patience. Most of the players who started were playing for Belgium at 16, 17 or 18. We have shown we can be aggressive, we have shown that even though we are young, we have experience,” he said. “I think we can play well against anyone – it was good to win and now we can grow into the tournament.”	Football
11502	11503	Ukip, the Tory MP and her father: the candidate who temporarily wasn't 	"The Conservative party and Ukip have been involved in a plot worthy of The Thick of It after the father of the backbench Tory MP Priti Patel embarked on a double U-turn over his candidacy for Britain's new insurgent force. As Lord Tebbit provoked Downing Street by offering a carefully qualified endorsement of Ukip, the party leader, Nigel Farage, proudly announced that the father of one of the most prominent Thatcherite MPs would be standing in Hertfordshire in Thursday's local elections. Within a few hours of the announcement Conservative sources said that Patel, who shares his daughter's admiration for Thatcher, would not be standing for their rivals. Ukip then released a statement saying that Sushil Patel would after all be standing in the Bushey South ward in the Hertfordshire county council elections, but that he would not conduct any interviews as he recovers from an operation. It is understood that Patel Sr, who had been warned by the Tories that his candidacy would do his daughter no favours, decided to stay in the race after it was pointed out that candidates could only withdraw by noon 16 days before an election. In the statement he said: ""I am proud of being a Ukip candidate and very proud of the achievements of my daughter who represents the people of Witham in an exemplarily fashion. My views are my own and I am astonished that there has been quite so much interest in my candidacy."" Priti Patel : ""He's my dad and I love him."" The announcement that Sushil Patel – whose daughter says Thatcher inspired her to enter politics – is standing came as a welcome boost for Ukip which says it is casting itself as Britain's true Thatcherite party. Priti Patel first made her name working for the Referendum party of the late Jimmy Goldsmith. Farage said the candidacy of Patel Sr, who fled to Britain from Uganda in the 1960s to escape the dictatorship of Idi Amin, for Ukip showed that the party was not opposed to all immigration. He said: ""Mr Patel … came to Britain in 1972 when Amin was trying to kill all the Asians. It was a proposed genocide by Amin. We had a huge debate in Britain about could we accommodate the sheer numbers; could we cope with a refugee influx on that scale. We concluded that morally we had no choice but to give those people refuge, and 27,000 came. ""Could we open the doors to Poland and several other eastern European countries in 2004? In two years a million came. We are dealing with something now on a completely different scale. More people came here in 2010 than came here – excluding wartime – between 1066 and 1950. It really is a question of scale. Our strong feeling is that giving away control of who comes to live, work and settle in your country is a rather irresponsible and rather stupid thing to do."" The news that Sushil was Priti's father only reached the Ukip leadership on Monday. As Patel Sr filled out a form to win a place on the list of approved Ukip parliamentary candidates, he contacted his local chairman to say that the only person who could verify it was his daughter, a Conservative MP. It took some time for this useful nugget of information to reach Farage's aides. But once they knew, Farage trumpeted the news at the first high-profile campaign event. The party has faced a difficult few days amid press revelations that some candidates are former BNP members and at least one holds allegedly anti-Semitic views. One source said: ""Sushil Patel is an absolutely bloody decent chap."" The confusion over the Patel candidacy came as Tebbit accused the Tory leadership of launching a smear campaign against Ukip, and all but endorsed the party. Writing on his , the former Conservative chairman said he would be voting Tory in Suffolk for pragmatic reasons to ensure his council did not fall into Labour, Lib Dem of Green hands. But Tebbit added: ""Of course it may well be that many former Conservative voters are so fed up with the Cameron coalition that they will turn to Ukip as the party which comes closest to a traditional Conservative agenda, and a reasoned position on the European issue. One can hardly blame them for that."" Ukip could face an investigation by the broadcasting watchdog, Ofcom, over accusations it made misleading claims in its party election broadcast over Britain's contribution to the EU. The pro-European British Influence thinktank lodged a complaint after Ukip claimed that Britain was ""sending £53m a day to Brussels"". The thinktank says the figure is less than £19m a day. Its director, Peter Wilding, said: ""Ukip are spinning figures about the EU when the true cost is much smaller and balanced by benefits. We'd like to see a debate based on the facts and not spin and that's why we have written to Nigel Farage and made this complaint."" An Ofcom spokesman said: ""Ofcom can confirm that it has received a complaint regarding a party election broadcast by Ukip, which we are assessing but not currently investigating."" A Ukip candidate in Somerset who was suspended by the party after photos were published of him apparently making a Nazi salute said the allegations were completely untrue. Alex Wood, 22, claimed that he was simply reaching out for a friend's mobile phone during a Halloween party where he was dressed as a pirate. Wood told the BBC: ""The supposed salute was my left hand reaching for my friend's mobile. My Facebook account has been hacked. This matter is being dealt with by the police. I see myself as a democratic libertarian. Racist, homophobic, fascist views absolutely disgust me. So these statements are not mine."""	Politics

The deal could become the biggest to be wrecked by the White House’s clampdown on tax inversions. Shares in Shire, best known for its hyperactivity drugs although it now focuses on rare diseases, crashed 28%, or £14.40, to £36.90, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index. in AstraZeneca, also a takeover target, fell 4.1% while hips-and-knees maker Smith & Nephew slid 3.1%. AbbVie said its board would meet next Monday to reconsider the to vote for the merger agreement, which would create one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The Chicago-based firm had planned to shift its tax base from the US to Britain as part of the deal to cut its corporation tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. Last month US Treasury officials unveiled new rules to make it harder for American companies to complete tax inversion deals. The measures bar companies from using cash held overseas to fund such takeovers. reignited the debate over inversions, which Barack Obama has denounced as unpatriotic. Referring to the new tax rules, AbbVie said it would discuss the “impact to the fundamental financial benefits of the transaction” and consider whether to withdraw or modify its recommendation. Some analysts speculated whether the takeover could be renegotiated, while others think it is dead in the water. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said: “The likelihood of the AbbVie/Shire deal has all but disappeared judging by the market reaction, whilst the possibility of Pfizer approaching AstraZeneca anew must also be in serious jeopardy, both falling foul of the potential tightening of US tax inversion laws.” AbbVie will have to pay a hefty break fee of $1.6bn to Shire if it decides to walk away from the deal. US hedge funds including Paulson & Co and Elliott Capital, which have been buying up Shire’s shares, will be among the losers if the takeover collapses. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: “Shareholders in Shire must be doing a double-take this morning with shares back trading at mid-June levels. It still stands to pick up a handsome $1.6bn in deal break fees. “However, that’s far from compensation for the £10bn market cap gains (40% share price rise), which many considered to be in the bag with the deal set to close in the fourth quarter.” Shire said it was notified overnight by AbbVie of its plans, but said the US company had not quantified the anticipated financial impact of the clampdown on tax inversions. “The board of Shire believes that AbbVie should proceed with the recommended offer on the agreed terms in accordance with the cooperation agreement,” the UK company said. Its board will meet to discuss the situation. in retention payments if the deal went ahead. Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon still expects the deal to go through. He notes the anti-inversion changes will require Senate support and “this is far from being a certainty and will likely take considerable time”. Ana Nicholls, healthcare analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that tax savings aside, there are other benefits to the deal. AbbVie faces patent expiry on its main product, Humira for rheumatoid arthritis, the world’s top-selling medicine. Shire has a strong lineup of hyperactivity drugs, along with a promising portfolio of drugs for rare diseases. “This is only a rethink, in short, and AbbVie’s board may instead recommend a modification of the deal – which could mean trying to renegotiate the price or change other terms of the deal,” Nicholls said. Other US companies looking to redomicile abroad to make huge tax savings include Pfizer, whose . The Viagra maker could come back with a new bid late next month after a six-month cooling-off period expires. Two days ago, Ohio-based for $1.9bn in a deal that would shift its tax domicile to the UK, cutting its tax rate from 31% to 25%. It is the second planned inversion deal announced since the Obama administration tightened its rules. The top federal corporate tax rate in the US is 35% while the average in Europe is 20%, according to Douglas S Shire is scheduled to publish third-quarter results next Friday. Following record quarterly revenues in the second quarter, trading has remained strong, it said.	Business
11390	11391	David Cameron: blame education not migration for factories' foreign labour 	"Eastern European immigrants should not be blamed for seeking jobs in UK factories when not enough young people in Britain are fully capable of doing the same jobs, has said. The prime minister said half the workforce in some factories came from Poland, Lithuania or Latvia, as people from those countries wanted to work and were well qualified. During a trip to a Mini plant in Oxford on Monday, he said Britain's response should be to improve the education system ""so we are producing young people out of our schools and colleges who are fully capable of doing those jobs"". ""You can go to factories in our country where half the people come from Poland, Lithuania or Latvia,"" Cameron said. ""You can't blame them – they want to work, they see the jobs, they come over and they do them. ""But as a country what we ought to be saying is: 'No, let's get our education system right so we are producing young people out of our schools and colleges who are fully capable of doing those jobs.'"" He said the key was linking education, welfare reform and immigration, but there was a risk that some under-qualified young people would be left behind in the recovery. ""Crack those three problems together and we can really get an economy that generates wealth for our people,"" he said. ""The danger for a country like Britain is, yes, you see the economy recover, yes, you see jobs coming, but you leave behind people who have not got the right qualifications from school. I don't want that to happen in our country."""	Politics

If all you need is to browse the web and do some simple word processing then a is ideal, but it will not run applications like iTunes or Word, instead relying on Microsoft Office-compatible Google Docs and other web apps. The Chromebook 11 is the best Chromebook available, with a solid build quality, excellent full-size keyboard and trackpad.

1263	1264	Warsi hits back at Osborne: 'George is a good friend of the Israeli government' 	"Sayeeda Warsi has attacked for failing to raise enough concerns with Israel about its bombing of Gaza, and urged other ministers who are privately expressing concern about the crisis to speak out. The senior Conservative directed her ire at the chancellor after he said her resignation over the government's position on Gaza was ""disappointing and frankly unnecessary"". Speaking to Channel 4 News, Warsi also revealed there is concern ""at ministerial level"" about the government's failure to condemn Israel's shelling of civilians in Gaza as disproportionate. One minister has talked about resigning and another senior Conservative backbencher has been in tears on the phone about it, she said. Asked about Osborne's comments, she said: ""George is a very good friend of the Israeli government and therefore he, more than anybody else, should have been saying quite frankly to the Israeli government that what you are doing is not in your interest. This is probably the biggest single act of self-harm that the Israeli government has done over the last few years. What he should have been saying to the Israeli government is that it is unnecessary for you to kill innocent civilians, to displace a quarter of the Gazan population, for you to flatten schools, hospitals and power supplies and water supplies to achieve your end. Had George done that, I agree with him that it would not have been necessary for me to resign."" She added: ""I think it's a sincerely held view that the best way to resolve this matter is to be as accommodating as possible to the Israeli government, to seek influence with them and through that to try and move them to a more positive decision. I'm not sure that policy is working."" Warsi also lifted the lid on unhappiness within the ranks of the Conservative party about the response to the conflict, which has now been going on for a month. ""Without dropping people in it I can say there is unease on the backbenches, there is concern at ministerial level,"" she said. ""I have had one senior Conservative on the phone in tears about material that they had seen and the fact they felt we weren't doing anything about it. I've had a minister in a late night conversation talking about resignation. There is real concern among Conservatives about this issue. I hope if there is some good that comes out of it people who feel the same way as I do are prepared to raise these voices within government and are taken seriously."" One of the peer's major points of concern has been David Cameron's refusal to say that Israeli action in Gaza has been ""disproportionate"" like he did when the country launched an incursion into Lebanon in 2006. While the prime minister has said the UN was right to condemn a bombing near a third school, he has otherwise only called for an immediate ceasefire, while taking care to blame Hamas for sparking the conflict. ""I think for me it's morally indefensible where after four weeks of a conflict more than a quarter of the Gazan population displaced, more than 2,000 people killed, more than 400 innocent children killed, we still cannot find the words to say, we condemn this and we feel this action has been disproportionate. These issues are too serious for us to be mealy-mouthed and for us to be dragging our heels."" Warsi gave the interview after earlier releasing her resignation letter to the prime minister, which spoke of her concerns that the fall-out from the Gaza crisis could lead to radicalisation of young Muslims. ""There is no doubt there is the potential for radicalisation for young people,"" she said. ""I fundamentally believe the way in which we conduct ourselves domestically does impact on our reputation internationally, and the way we behave internationally does have blow-back domestically … It's not a claim I make there is evidence there in black and white in the work that the Home Office is doing. These reports and this evidence makes for uncomfortable reading but we can either bury our head in the sand and pretend it's not there."" Like Nick Clegg, she also called for the UK to stop selling arms and military equipment to Israel. ""It is wrong for a country to allow arms to be supplied to a potential warzone. It seems odd to have a policy that on the one hand we allow arms to be supplied and on the other we spend taxpayers money patching up the people who may have been injured from the use of those arms,"" she said. ""Therefore we've got to be bold in taking the decision and say until who have been alleged to have committed war crimes over the last few weeks have been brought to justice then we must stop selling arms to Israel."" Warsi said she might not have felt it necessary to resign had she been in another department but she found it too difficult to stand up in the every day and answer foreign policy questions related to the issue. Asked about whether there was a moment that made up her mind, she said: ""There were many moments. Every time a school was bombed. Every time you saw a picture of Gaza with no lights at night. Every time a child about the age of my own children was killed. The moment when young boys playing football on the beach were suddenly there no longer."""	Politics
15247	15248	World Cup 2014: Holland’s Nigel de Jong out of rest of the tournament 	Holland will be without Nigel de Jong for the rest of the through injury. The 29-year-old was forced off nine minutes into the ’s on Sunday with a groin complaint. Holland’s coach, Louis van Gaal, admitted after the last-gasp 2-1 win that De Jong was a doubt for their quarter-final clash against Costa Rica and the Dutch FA has confirmed the midfielder’s tournament is over. A post on read: “Nigel de Jong has a tear in his groin muscle. He’s probably out for two to four weeks. De Jong continues rehabilitation with #Orange.” Van Gaal had described De Jong’s expected absence from Saturday’s quarter-final as a “big setback” so the full severity of the injury will be an even bigger blow. His absence against Costa Rica and potentially beyond will harm Holland’s chances of reaching a second successive World Cup final. The have impressed so far in Brazil but Arjen Robben, speaking before the severity of the injury became clear, admitted De Jong would be a great miss. “It’s a hard blow for us that Nigel has been injured,” the winger said. “The possible absence of De Jong in the quarter-finals is a heavy loss. “But our strength is that every player who comes off the bench on to the pitch manages to have a big impact on the match. The confidence within our team is very big, in spite of any absence.”	Football
8879	8880	The best iPad apps for kids of 2014 	British books and apps publisher Nosy Crow has made a succession of beautiful fairytale apps, all with a strong eye on encouraging reading, not just tapping on interactive whizziness. was their best effort yet, blending storytelling and light gaming with the company’s now-familiar voice narration from children, not grown-ups. Now one of the most well-trusted brands in children’s apps, Toca Boca had another good year in 2014. was its standout app: a creative sandbox for children to grow trees, raise mountains and dig rivers and lakes, to see what kind of wildlife their mini-ecosystem attracts. Wonderful. Sago Sago is the preschool-focused sister studio of Toca Boca, and all of its apps are a treat for children. offers a great way in to its collection though: a road trip starring a colourful cartoon cat and his friends, with different cars to drive and plenty to see and tap on. Scratch is one of the most popular languages used in schools when children are learning computer programming schools. took the idea to tablets this year, from a team including MIT, which was responsible for Scratch. It’s an app that gets children to create stories by slotting together blocks of code: fun and creative. isn’t an app you download: instead, it’s a website that works on tablets. It’s a wonderful thing too: part game and part creative studio where your children draw animals to fill a magical zoo, illustrating their own stories as they go. It’s free, but parents can choose to pay for a subscription that includes a physical zookeeper welcome pack. Based on the well-regarded educational website, was an excellent app introducing children to synthetic phonics, as a complement to their learning in the classroom. Its fun, accessible games introduced the letter sounds although – important note – it’s describing your kids as monsters. Instead, teaching the in-game monster to read is key to the app’s structure. Even art galleries were releasing children’s apps in 2014: from Tate was a treat for children and parents alike. Based on Ruth Green’s charming book, it tells the tale of Sid the Snail, and his efforts to get some sleep. Your children have to draw their own characters while recording their noises, to take part in the story. is impressive: a proper, full-blown Skylanders game to match the console version, complete with its own joypad and portal stand so that kids can use their physical Skylanders toys. The game is free, but you’ll need to buy the physical “tablet starter pack” to play the full thing. Developer Bossa Studios made its name with games like Surgeon Simulator and Thomas Was Alone, which are more for adults. is different though: an excellent educational adventure with a focus on helping children practise their maths skills while saving heroine Twelve’s family. It’s never dry. Another app from Nosy Crow, but this time it wasn’t a story. This was a digital jigsaws app using the artwork from several of the company’s apps and books: one of the best attempts yet to take the idea of piecing puzzles together to the touchscreen. was also a responsible example of in-app purchases: parents could buy extra jigsaws via an in-app store, but if you own other Nosy Crow apps, their puzzles are unlocked for free. The two Star Walk apps have millions of happy adults using them to gaze at the nighttime skies. This year, their developer made a separate app for children: . It’s a cleverly-redesigned version of the adult app, helping kids point their iPad at the stars and learn about some of the constellations – with additional animated short films about the cosmos. Another example of an app for adults spinning off another version for children. Lumosity has millions of people using its main brain-training app, but was strictly for kids: a series of simple, colourful educational mini-games to help them practise core skills like sorting, paying attention and visual-motor coordination. All of developer Originator’s apps are worth a look: followed previous apps Endless Alphabet, Endless Reader and Endless Numbers. This latest app focused on spelling and word building, with a characterful troop of monsters acting out the rhyming puzzles. Nine words are included for free, with other packs available at £2.99 each as in-app purchases. Another developer whose back catalogue is worth digging into is Curious Hat, which makes creative, quirky apps that often aim to get children out into the real world, not just staring into a screen. is a good example: it challenges kids to record one-second videos based on random words, then turns them into mini-movies. Great fun for children, but just as good to collaborate on with you. may have been released for Halloween, but its appeal will last all year round. It gets children to play as a girl named Bonnie, who dresses up in a sheet and floats around the house scaring her family members by jumping out at them and shouting “BOO!”. Genuinely funny, and beautifully designed. The first in a new series of educational apps for children by Disney: is a collection of five mathematical mini-games hosted by Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Goofy. They’re elegantly done, with some features available in the free download, and others unlocked by parents through in-app purchases for each game’s zone. All primary-school children should now be learning computer programming skills (or at least “algorithmic thinking”) as part of the curriculum. is one of the apps that aims to help them practise at home: a collection of “coding puzzles” teaching kids about programming, with a sandbox mode to make their own games. In-app purchases buy additional puzzle packs. There are dozens of not-that-good dressing up games for kids, but is a cut above: an app that gets children to create their own outfits for virtual dolls, then snap pictures of them as they strut down a catwalk. As kids get used to it, their creations will get more ambitious, which is wonderful to watch. is a freeform world full of characters – some of whom featured in the company’s previous apps. Children can move them around, interact with items and – crucially – make up their own stories about what’s happening. Every child will discover their own favourite characters and locations, too. The Gruffalo finally got his own app in 2014, although it wasn’t an attempt to retell Julia Donaldson’s story. Instead, was a collection of mini-games based on his world and characters, from playing snap against the terrible-clawed fella himself, through to catching nuts and playing matching pairs. was a good example of one of the interesting children’s app trends of 2014: a move towards a form of digital storytelling that isn’t trying to be just a book, an animation or a game, but something that combines those elegantly. Here, that meant setting off on a quest for dinosaur bones with heroes Doug and Bonnie. The UK-only is the second official app from pre-school channel CBeebies: a collection of digital stories, rather than the games in CBeebies Playtime. Popular characters including Sarah and Duck, Peter Rabbit and Charlie and Lola star, with stories accompanied by questions to provoke discussion with your children. More dinosaurs here, in a well-crafted app by British developer Cowly Owl for young children. features a dinosaur stomping along, and chomping meat or foliage every so often, as it appears. But along the way, eggs appear too, with new parts to help kids mix’n’match their dino bodies. Dr Panda is another well-respected children’s apps brand, with a range of apps offering playful takes on grown-up professions. is pure playtime though: children drive various vehicles around a pair of cities, with a deliberate lack of a storyline to provide space for them to tell their own tales. Another BBC app – and thus, one for British children for now – which ties in to the quiz show spin-off from Horrible Histories. was one of the first mainstream “second screen” apps for kids, designed to be used while watching the TV show. Children answer questions and compete with the on-screen contestants. And it works with the repeats!	Technology

Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions showed that another year of stagnating inflation-adjusted earnings had prolonged the UK's lost decade of squeezed incomes. The DWP said median real terms household income growth before housing costs remained unchanged at £440 a week in 2012-13 after two years of falls. After housing costs, median incomes fell for a third consecutive year, from £377 a week to £374 a week. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said there had been a 6% drop in median incomes when adjusted for inflation since the peak, with a 9% fall in mean incomes. The former is calculated by taking the household in the middle of the income distribution, while the latter by dividing total household income by the number of households. ""The large post-recession falls in incomes followed a period of slow income growth that began in the early 2000s, far pre-dating the recession"","" the IFS said. ""The net result is that the official measure shows both measures of average income no higher in 2012–13 than in 2001–02."""	Business
